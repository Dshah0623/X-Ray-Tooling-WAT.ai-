      "What are Cy Twombly’s sculptures made of? This article presents an overview of a non-destructive",
      "examination conducted on three sculptures by American artist Cy Twombly (1928–2011) as part of an",
      "art-technological research project at the Doerner Institut in Munich. The artworks are part of the",

      "Sculptures’: assemblages of individual found objects, which the artist covered and modified with",
      "layers of plaster and white paint. To develop a long-term preservation strategy, the research",
      "focused on understanding the materials and construction methods used in Twombly's sculptures. In",
      "collaboration with the Chair of Non-Destructive Testing at the Technical University of Munich, the",
      "artworks were inspected using X-ray radiography and computed tomography. The results showed that Cy",
      "Twombly used various everyday objects made from wood, plastics, metal, and paper/cardboard to build",
      "the assemblages. Unexpectedly, the examinations revealed that the individual parts are solely held",
      "together by the coating of plaster and paint, lacking additional mechanical connections. The",
      "overall structure thus proved to be very fragile and highly sensitive to physical stresses, whether",
      "due to handling, transport, or strains in the microstructure caused by climatic fluctuations. Since",
      "little was known about Cy Twombly´s choice of materials and manufacturing details, the results",

      "High-resolution X-ray spectroscopy in the sub-nanosecond to femtosecond time range requires",
      "ultrashort X-ray pulses and a spectral X-ray flux considerably larger than that presently",
      "available. X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) radiation from hard X-ray self-seeding (HXRSS) setups",
      "has been demonstrated in the past and offers the necessary peak flux properties. So far, these",
      "systems could not provide high repetition rates enabling a high average flux. We report the results",
      "for a cascaded HXRSS system installed at the European XFEL, currently the only operating",
      "high-repetition-rate hard X-ray XFEL facility worldwide. A high repetition rate, combined with",
      "HXRSS, allows the generation of millijoule-level pulses in the photon energy range of 6–14 keV with",
      "a bandwidth of around 1 eV (corresponding to about 1 mJ eV –1 peak spectral density) at the rate of",
      "ten trains per second, each train including hundreds of pulses arriving at a megahertz repetition",
      "rate. At 2.25 MHz repetition rate and photon energies in the 6–7 keV range, we observed and",
      "characterized the heat-load effects on the HXRSS crystals, substantially altering the spectra of",
      "subsequent X-ray pulses. We demonstrated that our cascaded self-seeding scheme reduces this",
      "detrimental effect to below the detection level. This opens up exciting new possibilities in a wide",
      "range of scientific fields employing ultrafast X-ray spectroscopy, scattering and imaging",
      "techniques. A cascaded hard X-ray self-seeding system is demonstrated at the European X-ray",
      "free-electron laser. The setup enables millijoule-level pulses in the photon energy range of",

      "Summary This paper presents a comparison of quantitative computed tomography (QCT) and dual-energy",
      "X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in osteoporosis with vertebral fracture and osteoporosis without",
      "fracture. It has been proved that the volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) measured by QCT",
      "exhibits a stronger correlation with fracture risk than areal bone mineral density (aBMD) measured",
      "by DXA. Purpose This study aims to systematically evaluate the ability of QCT and DXA to",
      "distinguish between osteoporosis with vertebral fracture and osteoporosis without fracture",
      "according to vBMD and aBMD. Methods We conducted a primary literature search of the online",
      "databases up to 3 July, 2022, in both English and Chinese publications, combining synonyms for",
      "“QCT”, “DXA” and “osteoporosis”. The Newcastle–Ottawa scale (NOS) was employed to evaluate the",
      "quality of the selected articles. vBMD obtained through QCT and aBMD obtained through DXA were",

    "Abstract": [
      "316L stainless steel was manufactured by additive manufacturing (AM), and then, the samples were",
      "severely deformed by the high-pressure torsion (HPT) technique. The evolution of the microstructure",
      "was monitored by X-ray line profile analysis. This method gives the crystallite size and the",
      "density of lattice defects, such as dislocations and twin faults. The AM-processing of the HPT",
      "disks was performed in two different modes: the laser beam was parallel or orthogonal to the normal",
      "direction of the disks. The subsequent HPT deformation was carried out for ½, 1, 5 and 10 turns.",
      "The microstructure and hardness evolution during HPT were similar regardless of the laser beam",
      "direction. For both sample series, the minimum achievable crystallite size was about 30 nm, while",
      "the dislocation density and the twin fault probability got saturated at the values of 300–350 × 10",
      "14  m −2 and 3.5–4%, respectively. The microstructure evolution during HPT of the AM-prepared 316L",
      "steel was compared with the HPT-induced changes in an as-cast counterpart. It was found that while",
      "the AM-prepared 316L steel remained a single-phase face-centered cubic γ-structure during HPT, in",
      "the as-cast samples a body-centered cubic (bcc) martensitic α-phase became the main phase with",
      "increasing the imposed strain of HPT due to the lower Ni content. In the saturation state achieved",
      "by HPT the initially as-cast 316L steel had a considerably higher hardness (about 6000 MPa) than",

      "Background Myocardial bridges are congenital anatomical abnormalities in which myocardium covers a",
      "segment of coronary arteries, leading to stenocardia, myocardial ischemia, and sudden cardiac death",
      "in severe cases. However, automatic diagnosis of myocardial bridge presents significant challenges.",
      "Method A novel framework of myocardial bridge detection with x-ray angiography sequence is",
      "proposed, which can realize automatic detection of vessel stenosis and myocardial bridge. Firstly,",
      "we employ a novel neural network model for coronary vessel segmentation, which consists of both",
      "CNNs and transformer structures to effectively extract both local and global information of the",
      "vessels. Secondly, we describe the vessel segment information, establish the vessel tree in the",
      "image, and fuse the vessel tree information between sequences. Finally, based on vessel stenosis",
      "detection, we realize automatic detection of the myocardial bridge by querying the blood vessels",
      "between the image sequence information. Results In experiment, we evaluate the segmentation results",
      "using two metrics, Dice and ASD, and achieve scores of 0.917 and 1.39, respectively. In the",
      "stenosis detection, we achieve an average accuracy rate of 92.7% in stenosis detection among 262",
      "stenoses. In multi-frame image processing, vessels in different frames can be well-matched, and the",
      "accuracy of myocardial bridge detection achieves 75%. Conclusions Our experimental results",
      "demonstrate that the algorithm can automatically detect stenosis and myocardial bridge, providing a",
      "new idea for subsequent automatic diagnosis of coronary vessels."
