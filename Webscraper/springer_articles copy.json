    "abstract": "This paper demonstrates a new concept of using two-dimensional (2D) layered materials and their heterostructures for enhanced X-ray radiation shielding. This phenomenon is revealed by characterization on the X-ray shielding performances of several 2D materials with high atomic numbers (Z), including MoS 2 , antimonene (Sb), and MXene prepared as multi-layered and heterostructure films by assembly their few-layer sheets. Results showed considerable X-ray shielding enhancement of (40–50%) at 30 kVp for individual 2D multi-layered films compared with their bulk structures of these materials. Furthermore, when these multi-layered films were combined into laminar heterostructures structures (e.g., MoS 2  + MXene), further enhancement of 60% was achieved. The mechanism of the observed X-ray shielding enhancement by these multi-layered 2D structures is not clear at this stage. It is postulated to be the result of an additional multiple scattering and reflections of photons between multiple layers of 2D crystals inside the film, which does not occur in their uniform bulk materials. The presented results suggest that multi-layered 2D materials with high atomic numbers (Z) and their laminar heterostructures could offer a new and promising strategy for designing of a new generation of Pb-free radiation-shielding materials, which is urgently needed across broad sectors.

    "abstract": "Introduction The United Kingdom (UK) government's healthcare policy in the early 1990s paved the way adoption of the skills mix development and implementation of diagnostic radiographers' X-ray reporting service. Current clinical practice within the public UK healthcare system reflects the same pressures of increased demand in patient imaging and limited capacity of the reporting workforce (radiographers and radiologists) as in the 1990s. This study aimed to identify, define and assess the longitudinal macro, meso, and micro barriers and enablers to the implementation of the diagnostic radiographer musculoskeletal X-ray reporting service in the National Healthcare System (NHS) in England. Methods Multiple independent databases were searched, including PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE; Embase; CINAHL, and Google Scholar, as well as journal databases (Scopus, Wiley), healthcare databases (NHS Evidence Database; Cochrane Library) and grey literature databases (OpenGrey, GreyNet International, and the British Library EthOS depository) and recorded in a PRISMA flow chart. A combination of keywords, Boolean logic, truncation, parentheses and wildcards with inclusion/exclusion criteria and a time frame of 1995–2022 was applied. The literature was assessed against Joanna Briggs Institute's critical appraisal checklists. With meta-aggregation to synthesize each paper, and coded using NVivo, with context grouped into macro, meso, and micro-level sources and categorised into subgroups of enablers and barriers. Results The wide and diverse range of data ( n  = 241 papers) identified barriers and enablers of implementation, which were categorised into measures of macro, meso, and micro levels, and thematic categories of context, culture, environment, and leadership. Conclusion The literature since 1995 has reframed the debates on implementation of the radiographer reporting role and has been instrumental in shaping clinical practice. There has been clear influence upon both meso (professional body) and macro-level (governmental/health service) policies and guidance, that have shaped change at micro-level NHS Trust organisations. There is evidence of a shift in culturally intrenched legacy perspectives within and between different meso-level professional bodies around skills mix acceptance and role boundaries. This has helped shape capacity building of the reporting workforce. All of which have contributed to conceptual understandings of the skills mix workforce within modern radiology services.",

    "abstract": "A typical ground investigation for characterizing geotechnical properties of soil requires sampling soils to test in a laboratory. Laboratory X-ray computed tomography (CT) has been used to non-destructively observe soils and characterize their properties using image processing, numerical analysis, or three-dimensional (3D) printing techniques based on scanned images; however, if it becomes possible to scan the soils in the ground, it may enable the characterization without sampling them. In this study, an in-situ X-ray CT scanning system comprising a drilling machine with an integrated CT scanner was developed. A model test was conducted on gravel soil to verify if the equipment can drill and scan the soil underground. Moreover, image processing was performed on acquired 3D CT images to verify the image quality; the particle morphology (particle size and shape characteristics) was compared with the results obtained for projected particles captured in a two-dimensional (2D) manner by a digital camera. The equipment successfully drilled to a target depth of 800 mm, and the soil was scanned at depths of 700, 750, and 800 mm. Image processing results showed a reasonable agreement between the 3D and 2D particle morphology images, and confirmed the feasibility of the in-situ X-ray CT scanning system.",

    "abstract": "Real-time X-ray tomography pipelines, such as implemented by RECAST3D, compute and visualize tomographic reconstructions in milliseconds, and enable the observation of dynamic experiments in synchrotron beamlines and laboratory scanners. For extending real-time reconstruction by image processing and analysis components, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are a promising technology, due to their strong performance and much faster run-times compared to conventional algorithms. DNNs may prevent experiment repetition by simplifying real-time steering and optimization of the ongoing experiment. The main challenge of integrating DNNs into real-time tomography pipelines, however, is that they need to learn their task from representative data before the start of the experiment. In scientific environments, such training data may not exist, and other uncertain and variable factors, such as the set-up configuration, reconstruction parameters, or user interaction, cannot easily be anticipated beforehand, either. To overcome these problems, we developed just-in-time learning , an online DNN training strategy that takes advantage of the spatio-temporal continuity of consecutive reconstructions in the tomographic pipeline. This allows training and deploying comparatively small DNNs during the experiment. We provide software implementations, and study the feasibility and challenges of the approach by training the self-supervised Noise2Inverse denoising task with X-ray data replayed from real-world dynamic experiments.",

    "abstract": "Hospital emergency departments frequently receive lots of bone fracture cases, with pediatric wrist trauma fracture accounting for the majority of them. Before pediatric surgeons perform surgery, they need to ask patients how the fracture occurred and analyze the fracture situation by interpreting X-ray images. The interpretation of X-ray images often requires a combination of techniques from radiologists and surgeons, which requires time-consuming specialized training. With the rise of deep learning in the field of computer vision, network models applying for fracture detection has become an important research topic. In this paper, we use data augmentation to improve the model performance of YOLOv8 algorithm (the latest version of You Only Look Once) on a pediatric wrist trauma X-ray dataset (GRAZPEDWRI-DX), which is a public dataset. The experimental results show that our model has reached the state-of-the-art (SOTA) mean average precision (mAP 50). Specifically, mAP 50 of our model is 0.638, which is significantly higher than the 0.634 and 0.636 of the improved YOLOv7 and original YOLOv8 models. To enable surgeons to use our model for fracture detection on pediatric wrist trauma X-ray images, we have designed the application “Fracture Detection Using YOLOv8 App” to assist surgeons in diagnosing fractures, reducing the probability of error analysis, and providing more useful information for surgery.",

    "abstract": "Carbonate rocks have complex pore structures as a result of sedimentological and diagenetic processes. We investigated the pore network of four carbonate rock samples originating from an oil well in Hungary. Two samples were from the productive part of the Sarmatian limestone, and the other two were from the dry interval. We employed X-ray computed tomography (micro-XCT) in combination with lab measurements and microfacies analysis. To achieve accurate X-ray image segmentation we investigated and compared several segmentation techniques, including entropy and clustering. We then employed the Naïve Bayes classifier and tenfold cross-validation to assess the accuracy of our results. Our study achieved high accuracy with the type-2 fuzzy entropy technique on various metrics, including precision and recall. The comparison between the measured helium porosity and image-derived porosity showed a close match. Micro-XCT measurements revealed connected pore structure in the productive interval, compared to isolated pores in the dry interval. Microfacies analyses indicated that both the rocks of the productive and dry intervals were deposited in a marine environment, but different diagenetic processes altered the sediment into productive and dry rocks, respectively. The diagenesis of the productive rocks occurred in a meteoric phreatic environment, where secondary pores were created (porosity enhancement). In contrast, the dry rocks underwent meteoric vadose and marine diagenesis, where all previously created pores were filled with cement (porosity destruction). Our study highlights the importance of accurately characterizing the pore network of carbonate rocks, which can aid in understanding reservoir properties and predicting fluid flow behavior.",

    "abstract": "Background The current research aims to determine the pharmacokinetic parameters, mucoadhesive strength, and IVIVC correlation of the novel chronotherapeutic drug delivery system of montelukast sodium (MTS) loaded Parteck® SRP80 and hypromellose system. To accomplish this, an HPLC method was developed which is highly sensitive, precise, and rapid for quantifying pure MTS in rabbit plasma. Mucoadhesive strength and time-dependent mobility of developed formulation were established by ex-vivo study and X-ray radiography, respectively. Using a fraction of drug absorbed (FDA) and a fraction of drug released (FDR), Level-A in-vitro in-vivo correlation (IVIVC) was developed. According to ICH Q1A (R2) standards, stability experiments were conducted for 180 days. Result MTS retention time came as 3.971 min with a mobile phase of methanol: acetonitrile: 0.2 mM sodium acetate buffer (5:90:5). In-vitro dissolution showed pulsatile release of the drug up to 24 h with two lag phases. The in-vivo study showed a C max of 490.16 ± 33.95 ng/ml, T max of 9 h, and MRT of 14.08 ± 1.21 h. The correlation coefficient of 0.9899 confirmed the level-A IVIVC. Uncoated matrix tablet of Parteck® SRP 80 displayed mucoadhesive strength 1.25-fold higher than hypromellose. Stability experiments found no significant changes in drug content, physical appearance, and cumulative percentage release with a similarity factor of 87–90. Conclusion A single oral dose in-vivo study proved the sustained release of the drug for 24 h with satisfactory mucoadhesive strength. Moreover, X-ray radiography has confirmed the time-dependent presence of formulation at the needed spot. This study fulfilled all the requirements for chronotherapy of asthma and can be scaled up in the future. Graphical abstract ",

    "abstract": "X-ray ptychography offers high-resolution imaging of large areas at a high computational cost due to the large volume of data provided. To address the cost issue, we propose a physics-informed unsupervised classification algorithm that is performed prior to reconstruction and removes data outside the region of interest (RoI) based on the multimodal features present in the diffraction patterns. The preprocessing time for the proposed method is inconsequential in contrast to the resource-intensive reconstruction process, leading to an impressive reduction in the data workload to a mere 20% of the initial dataset. This capability consequently reduces computational time dramatically while preserving reconstruction quality. Through further segmentation of the diffraction patterns, our proposed approach can also detect features that are smaller than beam size and correctly classify them as within the RoI.",

    "abstract": "What are Cy Twombly’s sculptures made of? This article presents an overview of a non-destructive examination conducted on three sculptures by American artist Cy Twombly (1928–2011) as part of an art-technological research project at the Doerner Institut in Munich. The artworks are part of the collection of the Brandhorst Museum and belong to Twombly’s series of so-called ‘Original Sculptures’: assemblages of individual found objects, which the artist covered and modified with layers of plaster and white paint. To develop a long-term preservation strategy, the research focused on understanding the materials and construction methods used in Twombly's sculptures. In collaboration with the Chair of Non-Destructive Testing at the Technical University of Munich, the artworks were inspected using X-ray radiography and computed tomography. The results showed that Cy Twombly used various everyday objects made from wood, plastics, metal, and paper/cardboard to build the assemblages. Unexpectedly, the examinations revealed that the individual parts are solely held together by the coating of plaster and paint, lacking additional mechanical connections. The overall structure thus proved to be very fragile and highly sensitive to physical stresses, whether due to handling, transport, or strains in the microstructure caused by climatic fluctuations. Since little was known about Cy Twombly´s choice of materials and manufacturing details, the results offer valuable insights into the overall artistic process and decision-making of one of the most influential artists of the 20th/twenty-first centuries. Conservators can use the art-technological findings to monitor the sculptures ‘condition and develop or adapt long-term preservation strategies, including aspects such as ambient climatic conditions and handling storage and transport specifications. In addition, the knowledge generated can be used for further research on the specific materials and transferred to other artworks by Cy Twombly.",

    "abstract": "Background Chest x-ray is commonly used for pulmonary abnormality screening. However, since the image characteristics of x-rays highly depend on the machine specifications, an artificial intelligence (AI) model developed for specific equipment usually fails when clinically applied to various machines. To overcome this problem, we propose an image manipulation pipeline. Methods A total of 15,010 chest x-rays from systems with different generators/detectors were retrospectively collected from five institutions from May 2020 to February 2021. We developed an AI model to classify pulmonary abnormalities using x-rays from a single system. Then, we externally tested its performance on chest x-rays from various machine specifications. We compared the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) of AI models developed using conventional image processing pipelines (histogram equalization [HE], contrast-limited histogram equalization [CLAHE], and unsharp masking [UM] with common data augmentations) with that of the proposed manipulation pipeline (XM-pipeline). Results The XM-pipeline model showed the highest performance for all the datasets of different machine specifications, such as chest x-rays acquired from a computed radiography system ( n  = 356, AUC 0.944 for XM-pipeline versus 0.917 for HE, 0.705 for CLAHE, 0.544 for UM, p $$\\le$$ ≤ 0.001, for all) and from a mobile x-ray generator ( n  = 204, AUC 0.949 for XM-pipeline versus 0.933 for HE, p  = 0.042, 0.932 for CLAHE ( p  = 0.009), 0.925 for UM ( p  = 0.001). Conclusions Applying the XM-pipeline to AI training increased the diagnostic performance of the AI model on the chest x-rays of different machine configurations. Relevance statement The proposed training pipeline would successfully promote a wide application of the AI model for abnormality screening when chest x-rays are acquired using various x-ray machines. Key points • AI models developed using x-rays of a specific machine suffer from generalization. • We proposed a new image processing pipeline to address the generalization problem. • AI models were tested using multicenter external x-ray datasets of various machines. • AI with our pipeline achieved the highest diagnostic performance than conventional methods.

    "abstract": "The effects of X-ray irradiation, a potential disinfection method, produced in parchment samples with different extent of artificial ageing have been investigated to analyse the possible superposition effects of the irradiation-induced damage with the existing ageing associated deterioration. The study was carried out in modern parchment samples in which different degrees of artificial ageing were induced by exposing them to severe hygro-thermal conditions for various durations. The aged samples were subsequently irradiated with increasing X-ray doses (350–4000 Gy). The consequent deterioration effects were analysed using light transmission analysis (LTA), attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) and fibre optic reflectance spectroscopy (FORS) in order to evaluate possible changes in, respectively, the hydro-thermal stability, the collagen protein structure (hydrolysis/denaturation) and the optical absorption/reflectance properties of the collagen protein. The results show increasing additional deterioration with irradiation dose for non-aged and moderately aged parchment, until damage saturation occurs for more intensively aged samples where no substantial additional deterioration is induced by the irradiation. The combined results indicate that the ageing produces the more substantial deterioration with respect to that induced by the irradiation treatment employed for disinfection purpose.",

    "abstract": "Two different experimental techniques are employed to visualize the impact damage generated by a low-velocity impact on a carbon-fibre reinforced-polymer (CFRP) composite laminate. At the relatively low impact-velocity of 1.69 m.s −1 , and a corresponding impact energy of 7.5 J, used in the present work the damage induced in the CFRP panel is barely visible to the naked eye but the techniques of ultrasonic C-scan and X-ray computed tomography (CT) can detect the damage that has occurred. This damage is mostly interlaminar damage, i.e. delaminations, between the plies due to a change in modulus from one ply to the next in the laminate. This interlaminar damage is usually accompanied by intralaminar damage, e.g. matrix cracking, in the ply itself. The type and extent of damage detected from using these two techniques is discussed and the relative merits of these techniques are compared. In general, the CT gave the better resolved picture of damage but the lateral extent of the damage was underestimated relative to C-scan which was more sensitive to very fine delamination cracks. In addition, a numerical approach, based on a finite-element analysis model, is employed to predict the type, location and extent of damage generated by the impact event and the modelling predictions are compared to the experimental results.",

In this paper, the keyhole-induced vapor capillary formation in the melt pool is investigated by using an adjustable laser beam source. For this purpose, the aluminum A1050 specimen with a thickness of 0.5 mm is molten only with the heat conduction welding regime by using the ring-mode laser beam. Once the specimen is molten through, the core multi-mode laser beam is then applied to vaporize the melt and a transition to keyhole welding regime occurs. Therefore, the core multi-mode laser beam with an intensity value of 33.3 MW/cm 2 is investigated. The correlation between the keyhole-induced vapor capillary and the melt behavior is further investigated in this paper which was recorded with a high sampling rate of 19 kHz. In addition, a theoretical calculation about the keyhole depth is discussed in this paper.",

    "abstract": "Membrane-bound heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) apart from its intracellular localization was shown to be specifically expressed on the plasma membrane surface of tumor but not normal cells. Although the association of Hsp70 with lipid membranes is well documented the exact mechanisms for chaperone membrane anchoring have not been fully elucidated. Herein, we addressed the question of how Hsp70 interacts with negatively charged phospholipids in artificial lipid compositions employing the X-ray reflectivity (XRR) studies. In a first step, the interactions between dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) in the presence or absence of dioleoylphosphatidylserine (DOPS) and Hsp70 had been assessed using Quartz crystal microbalance measurements, suggesting that Hsp70 adsorbs to the surface of DOPC/DOPS bilayer. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging demonstrated that the presence of DOPS is required for stabilization of the lipid bilayer. The interaction of Hsp70 with DOPC/DOPS lipid compositions was further quantitatively determined by high energy X-ray reflectivity. A systematic characterization of the chaperone-lipid membrane interactions by various techniques revealed that artificial membranes can be stabilized by the electrostatic interaction of anionic DOPS lipids with Hsp70.",

    "abstract": "Over the past decade, the use of deep learning has been widely increasing in the medical image diagnosis field. Deep learning-based methods’ (DLMs) performance strongly relies on training data. Therefore, researchers often focus on collecting as much data as possible from different medical facilities or developing approaches to avoid the impact of inter-category imbalance (ICI), which means a difference in data quantity among categories. However, due to the ICI within each medical facility, medical data are often isolated and acquired in different settings among medical facilities, known as the issue of intra-source imbalance (ISI) characteristic. This imbalance also impacts the performance of DLMs but receives negligible attention. In this study, we study the impact of the ISI on DLMs by comparison of the version of a deep learning model that was trained separately by an intra-source imbalanced chest X-ray (CXR) dataset and an intra-source balanced CXR dataset for COVID-19 diagnosis. The finding is that using the intra-source imbalanced dataset causes a serious training bias, although the dataset has a good inter-category balance. In contrast, the deep learning model performed a reliable diagnosis when trained on the intra-source balanced dataset. Therefore, our study reports clear evidence that the intra-source balance is vital for training data to minimize the risk of poor performance of DLMs.",

    "abstract": "Introduction Self-monitoring is crucial to work progressively with a high-quality standard. A retrospective analysis is a valuable tool for studying the postoperative outcome of a prosthesis and for evaluating the learning process for the surgeon. Materials and methods The learning process of one surgeon was analysed in 133 cases of hip arthroplasty. These were divided into seven groups representing the surgical years 2008–2014. Over the course of 3 postoperative years, a total of 655 radiographs were analysed at regarding three radiological quality parameters (centrum-collum-diaphyseal angle (CCD angle), intramedullary fit&fill ratio (FFR), and migration) and ancillary outcome parameters (Harris Hip Score (HHS), blood loss, operating time, and complications). This period was divided into five times: 1st-day post-op, 6 M, 12 M, 24 M, and 36 M. Bivariate Spearman's correlation analysis and pairwise comparisons were performed. Results The total collective achieved a proximal FFR of over 0.8. The distal prosthesis tip migrated and was located on the lateral cortex within the first months. The CCD angle initially showed a variation with a subsequent constant course. The HHS showed a significant increase ( p  < 0.001) to over 90 points postoperatively. Over time, the operating time and blood loss decreased. Intraoperative complications existed only at the beginning of the learning phase. A learning curve effect can be determined for almost all parameters by comparing the subject groups. Conclusions Operative expertise was shown to gain through a learning curve, whereby postoperative results corresponded to the system philosophy of the short hip stem prosthesis. The distal FFR and the distal lateral distance could represent the principle of the prosthesis, which overall could be an interesting approach for verification of a new parameter.",

    "abstract": "This paper provides a fundamental understanding of “false friend” formation, i.e., hidden defects associated with lack of fusion, using an experimental setup that allowed an insight into the processing zone based on high-speed synchrotron X-ray imaging. The setup enabled the welding of a lap joint of AISI 304 high-alloy steel sheets (X5CrNi18-10/1.4301), with the ability to adjust different gap heights between top and bottom sheet (up to 0.20 mm) and to acquire high-speed X-ray images at 100 kHz simultaneously with the welding process. On this basis, a time-resolved description of the “false friend” formation can be provided by visualizing the interaction between keyhole and melt pool during laser welding and solidification processes within the gap area. The bridgeability of the gap was limited due to the gap height and insufficient melt supply leading to the solidification of the bridge. The distance between the solidified bridge and the keyhole increased with time, while the keyhole and melt pool dynamics initiated the formation of new melt bridges whose stability was defined by melt flow conditions, surface tension, and gap heights. The alternating formation and solidification of melt bridges resulted in entrapped areas of lacking fusion within the weld, i.e., “false friends.” Finally, based on the results of this study, a model concept is presented that concludes the main mechanisms of “false friend” formation.",

    "abstract": "Understanding and controlling protein motion at atomic resolution is a hallmark challenge for structural biologists and protein engineers because conformational dynamics are essential for complex functions such as enzyme catalysis and allosteric regulation. Time-resolved crystallography offers a window into protein motions, yet without a universal perturbation to initiate conformational changes the method has been limited in scope. Here we couple a solvent-based temperature jump with time-resolved crystallography to visualize structural motions in lysozyme, a dynamic enzyme. We observed widespread atomic vibrations on the nanosecond timescale, which evolve on the submillisecond timescale into localized structural fluctuations that are coupled to the active site. An orthogonal perturbation to the enzyme, inhibitor binding, altered these dynamics by blocking key motions that allow energy to dissipate from vibrations into functional movements linked to the catalytic cycle. Because temperature jump is a universal method for perturbing molecular motion, the method demonstrated here is broadly applicable for studying protein dynamics. Shifts in temperature alter the structure and dynamics of macromolecules. Now, infra-red laser-induced temperature jump is combined with X-ray crystallography to observe protein structural dynamics in real time. Using this method, motions related to the catalytic cycle of lysozyme, a model enzyme, are visualized at atomic resolution and across broad timescales.",

    "abstract": "High-resolution X-ray spectroscopy in the sub-nanosecond to femtosecond time range requires ultrashort X-ray pulses and a spectral X-ray flux considerably larger than that presently available. X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) radiation from hard X-ray self-seeding (HXRSS) setups has been demonstrated in the past and offers the necessary peak flux properties. So far, these systems could not provide high repetition rates enabling a high average flux. We report the results for a cascaded HXRSS system installed at the European XFEL, currently the only operating high-repetition-rate hard X-ray XFEL facility worldwide. A high repetition rate, combined with HXRSS, allows the generation of millijoule-level pulses in the photon energy range of 6–14 keV with a bandwidth of around 1 eV (corresponding to about 1 mJ eV –1 peak spectral density) at the rate of ten trains per second, each train including hundreds of pulses arriving at a megahertz repetition rate. At 2.25 MHz repetition rate and photon energies in the 6–7 keV range, we observed and characterized the heat-load effects on the HXRSS crystals, substantially altering the spectra of subsequent X-ray pulses. We demonstrated that our cascaded self-seeding scheme reduces this detrimental effect to below the detection level. This opens up exciting new possibilities in a wide range of scientific fields employing ultrafast X-ray spectroscopy, scattering and imaging techniques. A cascaded hard X-ray self-seeding system is demonstrated at the European X-ray free-electron laser. The setup enables millijoule-level pulses in the photon energy range of 6–14 keV at the rate of ten trains per second, with each train including hundreds of pulses arriving at a megahertz repetition rate.",

    "abstract": "Summary This paper presents a comparison of quantitative computed tomography (QCT) and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in osteoporosis with vertebral fracture and osteoporosis without fracture. It has been proved that the volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) measured by QCT exhibits a stronger correlation with fracture risk than areal bone mineral density (aBMD) measured by DXA. Purpose This study aims to systematically evaluate the ability of QCT and DXA to distinguish between osteoporosis with vertebral fracture and osteoporosis without fracture according to vBMD and aBMD. Methods We conducted a primary literature search of the online databases up to 3 July, 2022, in both English and Chinese publications, combining synonyms for “QCT”, “DXA” and “osteoporosis”. The Newcastle–Ottawa scale (NOS) was employed to evaluate the quality of the selected articles. vBMD obtained through QCT and aBMD obtained through DXA were extracted, and were analyzed by Review Manager 5.4 and RStudio. Results Six studies with 610 individuals aged 45 to 90, of which 179 had vertebral fractures, were included in the final analysis. The weighted mean difference (WMD) between osteoporosis with vertebral fracture and osteoporosis without fracture for vBMD was − 27.08 (95% CI  − 31.24 to  − 22.92), while for aBMD was − 0.05 (95% CI − 0.08 to − 0.03). Conclusions Both vBMD detected by QCT and aBMD detected by DXA could discriminate fracture status in the spine, and vBMD performed a stronger correlation with fracture risk.

    "abstract": "Vascular calcification, an ectopic calcification exacerbated by aging and renal dysfunction, is closely associated with cardiovascular disease. However, early detection indicators are limited. This study focused on dental pulp stones, ectopic calcifications found in oral tissues that are easily identifiable on dental radiographs. Our investigation explored the frequency and timing of these calcifications in different locations and their relationship to aortic calcification. In cadavers, we examined the association between the frequency of dental pulp stones and aortic calcification, revealing a significant association. Notably, dental pulp stones appeared prior to aortic calcification. Using a rat model of hyperphosphatemia, we confirmed that dental pulp stones formed earlier than calcification in the aortic arch. Interestingly, there were very few instances of aortic calcification without dental pulp stones. Additionally, we conducted cell culture experiments with vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and dental pulp cells (DPCs) to explore the regulatory mechanism underlying high phosphate-mediated calcification. We found that DPCs produced calcification deposits more rapidly and exhibited a stronger augmentation of osteoblast differentiation markers compared with SMCs. In conclusion, the observation of dental pulp stones through X-ray examination during dental checkups could be a valuable method for early diagnosis of aortic calcification risk.",

    "abstract": "316L stainless steel was manufactured by additive manufacturing (AM), and then, the samples were severely deformed by the high-pressure torsion (HPT) technique. The evolution of the microstructure was monitored by X-ray line profile analysis. This method gives the crystallite size and the density of lattice defects, such as dislocations and twin faults. The AM-processing of the HPT disks was performed in two different modes: the laser beam was parallel or orthogonal to the normal direction of the disks. The subsequent HPT deformation was carried out for ½, 1, 5 and 10 turns. The microstructure and hardness evolution during HPT were similar regardless of the laser beam direction. For both sample series, the minimum achievable crystallite size was about 30 nm, while the dislocation density and the twin fault probability got saturated at the values of 300–350 × 10 14  m −2 and 3.5–4%, respectively. The microstructure evolution during HPT of the AM-prepared 316L steel was compared with the HPT-induced changes in an as-cast counterpart. It was found that while the AM-prepared 316L steel remained a single-phase face-centered cubic γ-structure during HPT, in the as-cast samples a body-centered cubic (bcc) martensitic α-phase became the main phase with increasing the imposed strain of HPT due to the lower Ni content. In the saturation state achieved by HPT the initially as-cast 316L steel had a considerably higher hardness (about 6000 MPa) than that for the AM-prepared samples (~ 5000 MPa) due to the large fraction of the hard bcc phase formed during HPT.",

    "abstract": "Background Spike is the grain-bearing organ in cereal crops, which is a key proxy indicator determining the grain yield and quality. Machine learning methods for image analysis of spike-related phenotypic traits not only hold the promise for high-throughput estimating grain production and quality, but also lay the foundation for better dissection of the genetic basis for spike development. Barley ( Hordeum vulgare L.) is one of the most important crops globally, ranking as the fourth largest cereal crop in terms of cultivated area and total yield. However, image analysis of spike-related traits in barley, especially based on CT-scanning, remains elusive at present. Results In this study, we developed a non-invasive, high-throughput approach to quantitatively measuring the multitude of spike architectural traits in barley through combining X-ray computed tomography (CT) and a deep learning model (UNet). Firstly, the spikes of 11 barley accessions, including 2 wild barley, 3 landraces and 6 cultivars were used for X-ray CT scanning to obtain the tomographic images. And then, an optimized 3D image processing method was used to point cloud data to generate the 3D point cloud images of spike, namely ‘virtual’ spike, which is then used to investigate internal structures and morphological traits of barley spikes. Furthermore, the virtual spike-related traits, such as spike length, grain number per spike, grain volume, grain surface area, grain length and grain width as well as grain thickness were efficiently and non-destructively quantified. The virtual values of these traits were highly consistent with the actual value using manual measurement, demonstrating the accuracy and reliability of the developed model. The reconstruction process took 15 min approximately, 10 min for CT scanning and 5 min for imaging and features extraction, respectively. Conclusions This study provides an efficient, non-invasive and useful tool for dissecting barley spike architecture, which will contribute to high-throughput phenotyping and breeding for high yield in barley and other crops.",

    "abstract": "X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) is a widely used X-ray diagnostic method for studying electronic and structural properties of matter. At first glance, the relatively narrow bandwidth and the highly fluctuating spectral structure of X-ray Free Electron Lasers (XFEL) sources seem to require accumulation over many shots to achieve high data quality. To date the best approach to implementing XAS at XFEL facilities has been using monochromators to scan the photon energy across the desired spectral range. While this is possible for easily reproducible samples such as liquids, it is incompatible with many important systems. Here, we demonstrate collection of single-shot XAS spectra over 10s of eV using an XFEL source, with error bars of only a few percent. We additionally show how to extend this technique over wider spectral ranges towards Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure measurements, by concatenating a few tens of single-shot measurements. Our results pave the way for future XAS studies at XFELs, in particular those in the femtosecond regime. This advance is envisioned to be especially important for many transient processes that can only be initiated at lower repetition rates, for difficult to reproduce excitation conditions, or for rare samples, such as those encountered in high-energy density physics.",

    "abstract": "Background This study aimed to conduct a case–control study of endoscopic and fluoroscopic metal stent placement combined with laparoscopic surgery versus conventional open Hartmann’s procedure in treating acute left-sided colon cancer obstruction. Additionally, the study aims to discuss the application value of endoscopic and X-ray-guided metal stent placement combined with laparoscopic surgery in the treatment of acute left-sided colon cancer obstruction. Methods From June 2011 to December 2019, 23 patients with acute left-sided colon cancer obstruction who underwent metal stent implantation combined with laparoscopic surgery under endoscopy and X-ray fluoroscopy in Wenzhou Central Hospital were collected, and 20 patients with acute left-sided colon cancer obstruction who underwent traditional emergency open Hartmann’s surgery during the same period were selected as a control group. All patients were diagnosed with left colon obstruction by plain abdominal film and/or CT before the operation and colon adenocarcinoma by colonoscopic biopsy and/or postoperative pathology. The operation time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative anal exhaust time, the success rate of one-stage anastomosis, postoperative hospital stay, and postoperative complications were compared between the two groups. Results This study showed a significant difference in the therapeutic effect between the two groups. Compared with the traditional Hartmann’s operation group, the success rate of one-stage anastomosis in endoscopic and X-ray-guided metal stent placement combined with the laparoscopic operation group was significantly higher than that in the Hartmann’s operation group ( P  < 0.05). The overall incidence of postoperative complications and hospital stay were significantly lower in the observation group than in the Hartmann’s group ( P  < 0.05). Further subgroup analysis of the overall postoperative complication rate of the two groups showed that the traditional Hartmann’s operation group was more likely to have an incomplete intestinal obstruction ( P  < 0.05). This study also showed no significant differences between the two groups in operation time, intraoperative blood loss, number of harvested lymph nodes, and postoperative anal exhaust time (all P  > 0.05). This study also found no significant differences between the two groups in overall survival rates or recurrence-free survival rates (all P  > 0.05). Conclusions The comparison of the therapeutic effects of the two groups verified the feasibility of endoscopy combined with X-ray fluoroscopy metal stent placement in combination with laparoscopic surgery in the treatment of acute left-sided colon cancer obstruction. Compared with the traditional emergency open Hartmann’s procedure, metal stent implantation under endoscopy and X-ray fluoroscopy combined with laparoscopic surgery is more minimally invasive, safe, and effective. It avoids the traditional second or even third surgical trauma to effectively improve the quality of life of patients, so that patients can recover quickly after surgery.",

    "abstract": "Filament winding is a technique to manufacture tubular composite structures and, therefore, is among the most appealing techniques for fabricating critical structures such as hollow tubes. Despite the recent advances, these structures are prone to a varying degree of porosity that may affect their mechanical performance. Therefore, the accurate detection and quantification of the manufacturing porosity is crucial. Micro-CT is most suitable for performing this activity at various scales. This work employs micro-CT for studying porosity inside an as-manufactured filament-winded composite structure. Void characteristics like volume, orientation, size, and relative volume fraction inside the hoop and helical layers are quantified inside a representative curved panel extracted from a glass fiber-vinyl ester tubular composite structure, which has not been studied in detail previously. It was observed that most voids are present in the matrix region. The voids are elliptical rod-like and spherical, with the latter present in the helical layers, which also host the majority of voids and the highest void volume fractions. The voids are highly aligned along the fiber orientation direction with higher misorientations for helical layers than the hoop layer. Large voids in base layers were created due to gaps formed during the winding process. Hence, the main goal of this study is to measure the voids' characteristics and the volumetric fraction during the stacking of filament wound hoop and helical layers during a generic filament winding pattern. The data can be further exploited as input for modeling filament winded composites in the presence of voids by researchers.",

    "abstract": "X-PDT is one of the novel cancer treatment approaches that uses high penetration X-ray radiation to activate photosensitizers (PSs) placed in deep seated tumors. After PS activation, some reactive oxygen species (ROS) like singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ) are produced that are very toxic for adjacent cells. Efficiency of X-PDT depends on 1 O 2 quantum yield as well as X-ray mortality rate. Despite many studies have been modeled X-PDT, little is known about the investigation of tissue oxygen content in treatment outcome. In the present study, we predicted X-PDT efficiency through a feedback of physiological parameters of tumor microenvironment includes tissue oxygen and oxygenation properties. The introduced physicochemical model of X-PDT estimates 1 O 2 production in a vascularized and non-vascularized tumor under different tissue oxygen levels to predict cell death probability in tumor and adjacent normal tissue. The results emphasized the importance of molecular oxygen and the presence of a vascular network in predicting X-PDT efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Background Myocardial bridges are congenital anatomical abnormalities in which myocardium covers a segment of coronary arteries, leading to stenocardia, myocardial ischemia, and sudden cardiac death in severe cases. However, automatic diagnosis of myocardial bridge presents significant challenges. Method A novel framework of myocardial bridge detection with x-ray angiography sequence is proposed, which can realize automatic detection of vessel stenosis and myocardial bridge. Firstly, we employ a novel neural network model for coronary vessel segmentation, which consists of both CNNs and transformer structures to effectively extract both local and global information of the vessels. Secondly, we describe the vessel segment information, establish the vessel tree in the image, and fuse the vessel tree information between sequences. Finally, based on vessel stenosis detection, we realize automatic detection of the myocardial bridge by querying the blood vessels between the image sequence information. Results In experiment, we evaluate the segmentation results using two metrics, Dice and ASD, and achieve scores of 0.917 and 1.39, respectively. In the stenosis detection, we achieve an average accuracy rate of 92.7% in stenosis detection among 262 stenoses. In multi-frame image processing, vessels in different frames can be well-matched, and the accuracy of myocardial bridge detection achieves 75%. Conclusions Our experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm can automatically detect stenosis and myocardial bridge, providing a new idea for subsequent automatic diagnosis of coronary vessels.",

    "abstract": "Resonant oscillators with stable frequencies and large quality factors help us to keep track of time with high precision. Examples range from quartz crystal oscillators in wristwatches to atomic oscillators in atomic clocks, which are, at present, our most precise time measurement devices 1 . The search for more stable and convenient reference oscillators is continuing 2 – 6 . Nuclear oscillators are better than atomic oscillators because of their naturally higher quality factors and higher resilience against external perturbations 7 – 9 . One of the most promising cases is an ultra-narrow nuclear resonance transition in 45 Sc between the ground state and the 12.4-keV isomeric state with a long lifetime of 0.47 s (ref.  10 ). The scientific potential of 45 Sc was realized long ago, but applications require 45 Sc resonant excitation, which in turn requires accelerator-driven, high-brightness X-ray sources 11 that have become available only recently. Here we report on resonant X-ray excitation of the 45 Sc isomeric state by irradiation of Sc-metal foil with 12.4-keV photon pulses from a state-of-the-art X-ray free-electron laser and subsequent detection of nuclear decay products. Simultaneously, the transition energy was determined as $${\\mathrm{12,389.59}}_{+0.12\\left({\\rm{syst}}\\right)}^{\\pm 0.15\\left({\\rm{stat}}\\right)}\\,{\\rm{eV}}$$ 12,389.59 + 0.12 syst ± 0.15 stat eV with an uncertainty that is two orders of magnitude smaller than the previously known values. These advancements enable the application of this isomer in extreme metrology, nuclear clock technology, ultra-high-precision spectroscopy and similar applications. Resonant X-ray excitation of the  45 Sc nuclear isomeric state was achieved by irradiation of a Sc-metal foil with 12.4-keV photon pulses from a state-of-the-art X-ray free-electron laser, allowing a high-precision determination of the transition energy.",
