      "PARP4 is an ADP-ribosyltransferase that resides within the vault ribonucleoprotein organelle. Our knowledge of PARP4 structure and biochemistry is limited relative to other PARPs. PARP4 shares a region of homology with PARP1, an ADP-ribosyltransferase that produces poly(ADP-ribose) from NAD+ in response to binding DNA breaks. The PARP1-homology region of PARP4 includes a BRCT fold, a WGR domain, and the catalytic (CAT) domain. Here, we have determined X-ray structures of the PARP4 catalytic domain and performed biochemical analysis that together indicate an active site that is open to NAD+ interaction, in contrast to the closed conformation of the PARP1 catalytic domain that blocks access to substrate NAD+. We have also determined crystal structures of the minimal ADP-ribosyltransferase fold of PARP4 that illustrate active site alterations that restrict PARP4 to mono(ADP-ribose) rather than poly(ADP-ribose) modifications. We demonstrate that PARP4 interacts with vault RNA, and that the BRCT is primarily responsible for the interaction. However, the interaction does not lead to stimulation of mono(ADP-ribosylation) activity. The BRCT-WGR-CAT of PARP4 has lower activity than the CAT alone, suggesting that the BRCT and WGR domains regulate catalytic output. Our study provides first insights into PARP4 structure and regulation and expands understanding of PARP structural biochemistry."

      "INTRODUCTION",
      "In piezoelectric and ferroelectric materials, the couplings between lattice distortions and the polar order are pivotal for key applications, such as smart electromechanical microelectronic components, spintronic memories, or advanced photonics. With the demand for high-rate data processing, the control of these couplings at ultrafast time scales, i.e., in the picosecond range, is desirable. One way to reach this ultrafast regime is the use of ultrashort laser pulses. For example, ultrashort light pulses have induced mechanical strains of up to 0.1% in ferroelectrics. These strain levels compare to commercial electrically driven piezoelectric sensors. Therefore, the ultrafast photoexcitation of piezoelectric and ferroelectric materials has triggered a large interest to control and modulate the strain and to generate coherent acoustic and optical phonons with short light pulses. Even the switching of a ferroelectric polarization with short light pulses has recently been reported.",
      "Since the polar order and crystal lattice are intrinsically coupled by the piezoelectric effect, a full understanding of the structural distortions induced by light pulses is crucial for an insight into the light-driven manipulation of the polar order. To gain a full picture of ultrafast photo-induced distortions in ferroelectrics, access to the modulation of both the out-of-plane and in-plane components of the elastic distortions is essential. However, to date, several limitations exist. First of all, multidomain states, which are typical in ferroelectric materials, hamper this analysis, particularly in thin films with nanosize domains. The presence of various domains induces, indeed, an averaging effect on the photoinduced response, which precludes a straightforward description of the intrinsic interplay between light and lattice distortions. To obtain the clearest picture of these fundamental interactions, model systems are required, i.e., thin films consisting of a single ferroelectric domain. Second, most studies have been limited to the measurement of light-induced out-of-plane distortions precluding a full description of the light-induced lattice deformation. In the present work, we first of all overcome the limitation of the multidomain complexity by fabricating a high-quality epitaxial single-domain BiFeO3 film through strain and domain engineering. This archetypal system is a prerequisite for the understanding of the photo-induced response beyond bulk materials or multidomains states. Second, we combine time-resolved optical and time-resolved x-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments to determine the complete light-induced ultrafast deformation of the unit cell in a BiFeO3 thin film (Fig. 1). It enables us to access both in-plane and out-of-plane lattice distortions of BiFeO3 films in the picosecond regime. Our results show that the ultrafast light excitation engenders a bipolar strain pulse with a leading compressive front, followed by a tensile tail for the longitudinal component. Concomitantly, positive and negative shear strain components are revealed in these leading front and tail, respectively. This temporal and spatial reconstruction of the longitudinal and shear strain has never been revealed before. For clarity, compressive (negative) and tensile (positive) components of the longitudinal (shear) strain are indicated by green and orange arrows in Fig. 1. The out-of-plane parameter reaches maximal compression and expansion of 0.1 and 0.6% respectively. Simultaneously, we observe a transient shear strain corresponding to the in-plane lattice distortion and of bipolar nature with a maximum amplitude of 0.04%. Our full temporal and spatial reconstruction of the transient lattice distortions points to successive reorientations of the ferroelectric polarization. Hence, ferroelectric polarization can be modulated on the picosecond time scale by a light-induced strain wave.",

The purple arrow denotes the ferroelectric polarization (P). am, bm, and cm are the monoclinic axes of BiFeO3 and a, b, and c are the cubic axes of SrTiO3. The femtosecond laser pulse induces an out-of-plane longitudinal strain (sketches I and III) and an in-plane shear strain (sketches II and IV) in the ferroelectric lattice. The longitudinal and shear strains can be either positive (orange arrows, sketches I and II) or negative (green arrows, sketches III and IV). Positive (negative) longitudinal and shear strain values correspond to an out-of-plane expansion (contraction) and an increase (decrease) of the monoclinic distortion, respectively. The corresponding variation of the ferroelectric polarization direction is shown in purple for each strain component. The 12-nm buffer SrRuO3 layer is omitted for clarity.",

From XRD measurements, we identify the (100)m film orientation (Fig. 2A) and find the lattice parameters to be am = 5.662 Å, bm = 5.606 Å, cm = 3.905 Å, and monoclinic angle β = 89.5°. The bm axis is partially relaxed, and the cm axis is fully strained (Fig. 2, B and C), as previously observed.",

The insets in (F) and (G) show the 180° switched polarization after applying a dc voltage of 7 V to the bottom electrode. r.l.u., reciprocal lattice unit; A.U., arbitrary units.",
      "(100)m-oriented BiFeO3 films can show two different ferroelastic domain states, either with cm parallel or perpendicular to the [001]c axis of SrTiO3. For each ferroelastic domain state, two opposite polarization directions are possible, giving rise to four polar domain states in total. XRD reveals that the film is ∼99.5% a pure single ferroelastic domain (see Methods and note S1). In addition, the polarization-dependent optical birefringence shows a sinusoidal shape with transmittance maxima for light polarizations parallel to bm (Fig. 2D). As the SrTiO3 substrate is cubic and hence optically isotropic, the sinusoidal shape shows the macroscopic optical anisotropy of our BiFeO3 thin film and confirms the ferroelastic single-domain state.",
      "To investigate the polar domain states within the ferroelastic domain, we used piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) (Fig. 2, E to H; Methods; and note S1). The topography image exhibits uniaxial features parallel to the c axis of the substrate (Fig. 2E). The out-of-plane and in-plane PFM phase images are homogeneous (Fig. 2, F and G), which indicate a polar single-domain state. The out-of-plane component of the polarization points downward, and the in-plane component is antiparallel to [001]c SrTiO3. We rotated the sample by 90° (Fig. 2H) and repeated the scan. The absence of an in-plane PFM signal confirms the orientation of the polar single-domain state. This ferroelectric polarization is switchable with a dc voltage of 7 V applied between the SrRuO3 electrode and the PFM tip (insets of Fig. 2, F and G).",
      "Time-domain Brillouin light scattering",
      "Next, we explore the impact of an ultrashort light pulse on our single-domain BiFeO3 thin film. In our experiment, the light pulse impinges at normal incidence with a pump photon energy of 3 eV, which is larger than the BiFeO3 bandgap (see Methods). The absorption of a light pulse leads inevitably to the excitation of a strain pulse that propagates through the film perpendicular to its surface. The crystal symmetry of the BiFeO3 film (point-group m) allows for the generation of both longitudinal and transverse acoustic waves, i.e., out-of-plane and in-plane atomic motions, respectively.",
      "In a first step, we probe the change of the optical reflectivity in a pump-probe measurements with picosecond resolution. This allows us to reveal the different photo-induced acoustic modes through time-domain Brillouin light scattering (see Methods). The black curve in Fig. 3A shows the raw signal of the transient optical reflectivity as a function of time delay between the pump and the probe pulse. We subtract the electronic and thermal contributions of the raw signal and extracted the Brillouin oscillatory components of the time-domain optical reflectivity (Fig. 3A in red). To identify the oscillatory components, we conducted a standard Wavelet analysis on the oscillatory signal. This yields the signal strength in the frequency domain as a function of the time delay between the pump and the probe pulses (Fig. 3B, bottom). The data reveal three distinct modes at about 31, 43, and 66 GHz. To pinpoint the origins of these modes, we compare the mode frequencies with literature data on bulk BiFeO3 and SrTiO3 (see also note S2). We find that the mode frequencies match with the transverse (shear strain) and longitudinal Brillouin modes of bulk BiFeO3 and with the longitudinal Brillouin mode of SrTiO3, respectively. The deduced longitudinal (vL ≈ 4500 m/s) and shear (vT ≈ 3100 m/s) sound velocities in the BiFeO3 thin film are also consistent with the values found in bulk BiFeO3. Next, we investigate the signal evolution in time. Until ~40 ps, the experimental optical signal is dominated by the longitudinal acoustic phonon signal of the BiFeO3 layer. At ~40 ps, the signal exhibits a discontinuity (dashed purple line in Fig. 3, A and B). This abrupt signal change corresponds to the arrival of coherent longitudinal acoustic phonons at the BiFeO3-substrate interface. Thanks to a small acoustic reflection coefficient (see note S3), this acoustic mode is largely transferred into the substrate. After this acoustic transmission, the transverse acoustic mode dominates the experimental Brillouin oscillatory signal in the BiFeO3 layer until roughly 60 ps. At this time, the transverse mode is partly transferred into the substrate and partly reflected at the BiFeO3-substrate interface. Note that due to our measurement configuration, we can only probe the transmitted longitudinal acoustic wave in the cubic SrTiO3 substrate.",

The colored map represents the experimental signal in the time-frequency domain and shows the three distinct acoustics modes at 31 GHz (TA mode in BiFeO3), 43 GHz (LA mode in BiFeO3), and at 66 GHz (LA mode in SrTiO3). The vertical purple dashed line in (A) and (B) indicates the time delay when the LA wave in BiFeO3 arrives at the BiFeO3-substrate interface.",
      "To gain further insights, we have simulated the experimental strain signal in two steps. First, we model the lattice dynamics of the BiFeO3 thin film after the short laser pulse excitation by semicoupled equations of motion. This allows the evaluation of the dynamics of coherent acoustic phonons in the structure (see note S3). Second, the transient optical reflectivity is calculated on the basis of the standard photoelastic model (see Methods and note S3). In this simulation, because we do not know the photoelastic coefficients (for the longitudinal and the shear waves) involved in the Brillouin light scattering detection process in BiFeO3 and SrTiO3, we used them as free parameters to adjust the amplitude of the longitudinal and shear waves. The simulation results are displayed as dashed orange lines in Fig. 3A. The simulations are in excellent agreement with the experimental results even at longer time scales (inset of Fig. 3A). In Fig. 3B (top), we displayed the different waves that compose the total simulated signal as dashed lines. Hence, we can identify the different time windows where one specific acoustic mode dominates the signal.",
      "These preliminary all optical experiments demonstrate the possibility to light-induce longitudinal and transversal strain waves in our single ferroelectric domain BiFeO3 thin film. Next, we build up a detailed understanding of the evolution of the strain waves.",
      "Time-resolved XRD",
      "The time-domain Brillouin light scattering can probe acoustic phonons through the photoelastic interaction but cannot provide directly the amplitude of the photo-induced strain. In the next step, we quantitatively evaluate the strain amplitude within the unit cells. To do so, we turn to time-resolved XRD. This technique allows us to monitor the photo-induced strain pulse through the evolution of the Bragg peak positions with time. First, we have to identify suitable Bragg reflections. Here, a look on symmetry properties is insightful. With the point-group symmetry (m) of BiFeO3, the mirror plane lies perpendicular to the bm axis and contains the am and cm axes. Hence, the photoexcitation cannot lead to in-plane atomic displacements along bm due to symmetry principles (see note S4). In other words, the photo-induced stress must have two components: an out-of-plane and in-plane components. These two stress components cause then atoms to move simultaneously along out-of-plane and in-plane directions. Accordingly, photo-induced deformations comprise two strain components: the longitudinal strain ηL, which describes the expansion or contraction along am, and the shear strain ηT with atomic displacement along cm (Fig. 1). Diffraction measurements with Bragg planes (h0l)m and ( type gives access simultaneously to the longitudinal and shear strain. In contrast, the (hk0)m/()m planes are only sensitive to the longitudinal strain (see note S4). From an experimental point of view, we monitored the photo-induced transient evolution of different Bragg peak positions by so-called ω scans (i.e., rocking curves; see Fig. 4A, Methods, and note S4). In this geometry, the ηL and ηT strains translate into diffraction angles ω as followswhere ω′ and ω0 denote the time-dependent diffraction angle and the diffraction angle at equilibrium, respectively. A(θ, h, ) and B(θ, h, ) are positive crystallographic parameters. Details about the derivation of Eq. 1 can be found in the note S4. As we see in Eq. 1, measuring ω′ − ω0, with these set of Bragg peaks, allows us to reconstruct fully the light-induced strain evolution of ηL(t) and ηT(t) at the picosecond time scale.",
      "Time-resolved XRD experiments.",
      "(A) Sketch of the time-resolved XRD setup. Rocking curves (ω scans) were measured to record the evolution of the Bragg peak positions as a function of the time delay (Δt) between the optical pump pulse and the x-ray probe pulse. The SrRuO3 buffer layer is omitted for clarity. (B) Transient evolution of the 40 Bragg peak (red dots) after ultrashort laser pulse excitation compared to the reference unexcited Bragg peak (blue dots). The lines are the results of the fitting procedure (Methods).",
      "Equipped with these preliminary considerations, we embark to investigate the photo-induced strain in our BiFeO3 thin film. We select the Bragg reflections of the (40 and (403)m planes to access the longitudinal and shear strain distortions. In addition, we measure the Bragg reflections of the (530)m and (50)m planes as a reference for distortion of the longitudinal strain only. Figure 4B shows representative ω scans of the 40 Bragg peak for selected time delays between ~50 and 190 ps (red curves). The blue curve is the reference Bragg reflection of the unperturbed system. The transient evolution of the 40 Bragg peak profile reveals a complex behavior. First, within the first ~30 ps, the Bragg peak is highly asymmetric and is split into two contributions. Second, at longer time scale, only one Bragg peak exists and remains shifted to a lower angle up to the maximum measured time delay (~200 ps). This general trends is also shared by the 403m, 530m, and 50m Bragg reflections.",
      "For an in-depth analysis of the evolution of Bragg reflections, we have extracted the diffraction angles by a standard fitting procedure (Methods). Depending on the time delay, we have two or one Bragg peak to fit. Figure 5 (A and B) shows the ω′ − ω0 evolution for the four reflections as a function of the time delay. At first glance, the diffraction patterns of all four planes show similar behaviors. Past the time delay zero, the Bragg peak splits into two distinct Bragg reflections (later called negatively and positively shifted Bragg peaks), as shown in Figs. 4B and 5 (A and B). These two Bragg peaks indicate that, in the early moments, the BiFeO3 layer consists of two distinct regions: one under compressive strain [(ω′ − ω0) > 0] and the other under tensile strain [(ω′ − ω0) < 0], as we will describe later. One Bragg reflection [(ω′ − ω0) > 0] shows a steady shift from ω0 to ω′ − ω0 ≈ 0.2° and disappears at ~30 ps. In contrast, the second Bragg reflection [(ω′ − ω0) < 0] appears with the time delay zero at ω′ − ω0 ≈ −0.4°. The difference in ω′ − ω0 decreases over the first ~30 ps to ω′ − ω0 ≈ −0.15°, where it stabilizes for the maximal time delay of our measurements of ~200 ps. A closer look confirms the nearly identical temporal evolutions of the (530)m and (5)m Bragg reflections (Fig. 5A, right; note the apparent difference the (530)m and (5)m reflection around time delay zero results from the sharp signal change). Yet, the 403m and 40 Bragg peak shifts exhibit distinct changes in their temporal evolutions (Fig. 5B). In the time range where two Bragg peaks are detected (0 to 30 ps), whatever the peak we consider [(ω′ − ω0) > 0 or (ω′ − ω0) < 0], the shift of the 40 Bragg peak is always more pronounced (positively or negatively) than the shift of the 403m Bragg peak. For time delays of 40 to 120 ps, where we detect only one Bragg peak, being negatively shifted regarding to ω0, this behavior is reversed and the 403m Bragg peak shift becomes larger than that of the 40. Last, the diffraction angles of the 403m and 40 planes converge toward 200 ps. Crucially, the different behavior observed between 40 and 403m in Fig. 5B (right) proves that shear strain contributes to the Bragg shift, consistently with the model presented in Eq. 1.",

The right panels show the temporal evolution of the Bragg peaks positions change for the tensile and the compressive parts (inset) for the 530m/50m (top) and 403m/40 reflections (bottom).",
      "To extract the longitudinal and shear strain amplitudes quantitatively, we rewrite Eq. 1, expressing the longitudinal strain ηL and shear strain ηT in terms of a combination of the ultrafast light-induced changes of the diffraction patterns",
      "We use the experimental data (ω′ − ω0)403m and  shown in Fig. 5B to calculate the longitudinal and shear strains, which are displayed in Fig. 6 (A and B, respectively). We find that tensile (label 1 in Fig. 6A) and compressive (label 2 in Fig. 6A) longitudinal strain components coexist for the first 10 to 30 ps, consistently with the coexistence of positively and negatively shifted Bragg peaks. We also note that the compressive and tensile longitudinal strains deduced from the hk0m or from the combination of h0lm and h0 reflections have the same overall time dependence, which directly demonstrates that the extraction of the longitudinal strain does not depend on the selected Bragg peak, thus confirming the validity of the model presented in Eqs. 1 and 2. From the negatively shifted Bragg peak, we determine a maximal longitudinal strain of 0.6%. In the same time range, we also determine the shear strain amplitude, which we can extract from both the negatively (label 1 in Fig. 6B) and positively shifted (label 2 in Fig. 6B) Bragg peaks. We obtain 0.04% as the largest amplitude of the shear strain. The coexistence of positive and negative longitudinal and shear strains can be explained and simulated by the standard elastic response of a solid object to a photo-induced stress (see Fig. 6, C and D), which has been previously introduced to simulate the time-domain Brillouin light scattering experiment (Fig. 3 and note S3). When the light is absorbed in the bulk of the BiFeO3 layer near the surface, the light-induced stress generates a lattice strain pulse that propagates in both forward and backward directions. When the backward emitted strain pulse arrives at the mechanically free air-BiFeO3 interface, it is reflected and the sign of the strain reverses. As a result, the propagating strain pulse becomes bipolar (note S3). For example, if the initial longitudinal stress is negative (as in the case of thermal expansion), then the front of the strain pulse is compressive and its tail is tensile. Figure 6C illustrates this scenario with the simulation of the spatial dependence of the longitudinal bipolar strain pulse as it travels through the BiFeO3/SrRuO3/SrTiO3 system 30 ps after photoexcitation. In our experiment, the x-rays penetrate and probe the entire BiFeO3 layer at once, so that they can detect the regions exhibiting different strain fields simultaneously. This explains the coexistence of a compressive and tensile strain in the time-domain measurements shown in Figs. 6A-B, i.e., why we have a splitting of the Bragg peak in the early time-delays. Similar light-induced bipolar longitudinal strain waves have also been observed in other materials, such as InSb and SrRuO3. Fig. 6D illustrates the relationship between the negatively and positively shifted Bragg peaks and the positive and negative longitudinal strain present in the tail and front of the strain pulse, respectively. As previously mentioned, light also induces shear stress, which generates a bipolar shear strain pulse within the film (see note S3). This additional contribution of the shear strain components to the Bragg peak shift has a different sign in the front and the tail of the strain pulse and has a different impact on the 403m and 40 peaks as shown in Fig. 5B and summarized in Fig. 6D. This is in perfect agreement with our model presented in Eq. 1.",

The uniform macroscopic ferroelectric polarization before laser excitation is shown by the large purple arrow (sketch I).",
      "These results are worth emphasizing for two reasons. First, to the best of our knowledge, the longitudinal strain level achieved in this study is among the largest photo-induced longitudinal strain levels ever reported in BiFeO3 film. Similarly, high strain levels have been reported recently but only in multidomain BiFeO3 film. This efficient photo-induced strain is likely connected to efficient generation mechanisms of acoustic waves that combine light-induced thermal (ultrafast thermal expansion) and nonthermal (deformation potential mechanism, inverse piezoelectric effect) processes, as already discussed in the literature for the rhombohedral BiFeO3. Second, it is the first observation and evaluation of ultrafast light-induced shear strain component in ferroelectric thin films. Previous works, for example, on BiFeO3 and PbTiO3 thin films, targeted the out-of-plane motion only.",
      "In the next step, we can have a look at the details of the evolution of the longitudinal and shear strains as they propagate through the sample. Let us start with the longitudinal strain pulse (Fig. 6A). The compressive strain (label 2 for the front) increases as the strain pulse propagates toward the BiFeO3-substrate interface (see Fig. 6A and fig. S5) and reaches a maximum strain level at around 20 ps, where it vanishes. The tensile longitudinal strain region (label 1 for the tail) emerges as a steep increase and reaches its maximum amplitude within the first 10 ps. Subsequently, it decays and reaches a plateau at ~40 ps (denoted by the purple dashed line in Fig. 6A). Because of the small acoustic reflection coefficient at the interface, the longitudinal strain wave is transmitted almost entirely into the substrate after ~40 ps (RL ≈ 2%; note S3). The drop of the longitudinal strain at ~40 ps is perfectly consistent with the drop in the Brillouin oscillatory signal of the longitudinal mode in BiFeO3 in Fig. 3. This efficient strain transmission also explains why the compressive component (front) disappears and why only one Bragg peak remains after ~40 ps. The constant plateau-like longitudinal strain state after ~40 ps (labels 3 and 4 in Fig. 6A) results then from an overall expansion of the thin film caused by long-living and nonpropagating (at this time scale) thermal and/or electronic contributions. Next, we investigate the evolution of the shear strain (Fig. 6B). We remind that the shear strain is extracted by combining the nonequivalent responses of the 403 m/40 reflections (Figs. 5B and 6D) as explained in the second term of Eq. 2. The maximal amplitude of the shear strain is an order of magnitude smaller than that of the longitudinal strain. Directly after the time delay zero, the front of the shear strain pulse (label 2) shows a positive amplitude, i.e., the monoclinic distortion increases. This shear-pulse front vanishes at ~20 ps. On the contrary, the tail of the shear strain pulse (label 1) is negative from 0 to ~50 ps. Accordingly, the monoclinic distortion decreases. At ~50 ps, this propagating shear strain changes sign and the monoclinic distortion increases again. It remains positive up to the time delay of ~130 ps, where it vanishes (labels 3 and 4). The absence of the shear strain signal beyond 130 ps, i.e., the absence of a plateau-like behavior at long time scale, indicates a rather small contribution to the shear strain of the thermal and/or the long-living electronic processes. This positive shear strain from 50 to 130 ps may have two origins. (i) The reflection coefficient of the shear acoustic wave at the BiFeO3-substrate interface has a non-negligible negative value (RT ≈ −10%; note S4). Such a negative reflection coefficient can lead to a reverse of the strain sign when the tail of the shear strain impinges on the substrate. (ii) As BiFeO3 is elastically anisotropic, a mode conversion of the incident longitudinal wave into a shear wave may also occur. With a longitudinal strain 10 times larger than the shear strain, even a few percent of efficiency of this mode conversion could give rise or contribute to the shear strain between 50 and 130 ps.",
      "DISCUSSION",
      "Figure 6E provides a sketch of the temporal and spatial tracking of the longitudinal and shear strain fields. To help the reader, we label the sketches I to V in Fig. 6E. We link deformations of the film in Fig. 6E to the strain states in Fig 6 (A and B) with the labels 1 to 4. Sketch I represents the unperturbed monoclinic BiFeO3 film before the arrival of the light pulse. In sketch II, the light pulse has excited the strain pulse with longitudinal and shear components traveling through the BiFeO3 film at their respective velocities vL and vT. In the tail (label 1), the combination of a positive longitudinal and negative shear strains leads to an expansion of the unit cell along am together with a decrease of its monoclinicity. In the front (label 2), the longitudinal and shear strain have opposite signs. This leads then to a contraction of the unit cell along am together with an increase of its monoclinicity. As time goes on (sketch III), the strain pulse travels further through the BiFeO3 film and the longitudinal and shear components arrive at the interface at around 40 and 50 ps, respectively. In sketch IV, the longitudinal strain pulse has been transferred to the substrate. Only the long-living longitudinal strain component remains. Hence, the unit cell remains expanded along am (label 3). At this moment (~50 ps, label 3), the shear strain is nearly zero. Past this moment, the shear strain experiences a sign change and remains positive up to ~130 ps along with the long-living expansion along am (label 4 and sketch V).",
      "In BiFeO3 films, the electric polarization is locked to the lattice, which is a fundamental property for ferroelectrics. This so-called adiabatic approximation is relevant even at the picosecond time scale as supported by theoretical calculations and also recently discussed in ferroelectric superlattices submitted to a picosecond strain pulse. Assuming that the ferroelectric polarization equally follows the strain wave, as sketched in Fig. 6E (purple arrows), this entails an electric charge wave propagating at the speed of sound through the BiFeO3 film. The charge wave may even include electrostatic discontinuities because of the bipolar nature of the propagating strain wave. Considering the fast dynamics and the fundamental relation between a transient polarization and the current (), we can expect ultrafast strain-induced current approaching the terahertz range. This is a promising property for next-generation ferroelectric-based gigahertz-terahertz technologies. The full description of this charged propagating acoustic front requires additional experiments and is planned future work.",
      "In summary, we have used a combination of time-resolved XRD and optical ultrafast spectroscopy experiments to unravel the optically induced picosecond strain dynamics of a single-domain BiFeO3 thin film. We report maximum longitudinal and shear strain of 0.6 and 0.04%, respectively. These strain levels are comparable to those of commercially available electrically driven transducers. However, the important point is that the strain pulse here has a typical duration of tenths of picoseconds, corresponding to a typical bandwidth of 100 GHz, while electrically driven piezotransducers typically operate in the megahertz regime. This demonstrates that efficient conversion of light energy into mechanical energy is also possible at the picosecond time scale. We have also demonstrated the complex temporal and spatial profile of both the out-of-plane and in-plane strain components. As a result, the ultrafast light-induced strain dynamics modulate the ferroelectric polarization direction in time and space within the film. This work constitutes an important milestone toward the exploration of the rich lattice dynamics in complex ferroelectric textures, ranging from mosaic to self-organized periodic structures. Moreover, ultrafast light-induced anisotropic strains might be used to create new transient phases or to generate ultrashort current pulses based on strain-induced modulation of the polarization direction. In the quest for the ultrafast manipulation of the polar and magnetic orders in multiferroic compounds such as BiFeO3, future work will require considering the dynamics of the unit-cell strain to account for comprehensive (inverse) piezoelectric and/or (inverse) magnetostrictive effects at the picosecond time scale.",
      "METHODS",
      "Epitaxial thin-film growth",
      "A single-domain epitaxial BiFeO3 thin film was grown by pulsed laser deposition on a SrRuO3-coated (110)pc SrTiO3 substrate using conditions reported previously. Ablation was carried out by a KrF laser with wavelength λ = 248 nm at 5 Hz. The 12-nm layer of SrRuO3 was grown from a stoichiometric target at 660°C in 100 mtorr of oxygen with fluence of ∼2 J/cm2. The BiFeO3 layer was grown from a Bi1.1FeO3 ceramic target, while the substrate was held at 590°C in a background oxygen pressure of 100 mtorr. The thickness of the BiFeO3 layer is estimated at 180 ± 10 nm, extrapolated from the growth rate, taken from a sample grown directly beforehand on which x-ray reflectivity calibration was performed.",
      "XRD structural characterization",
      "The film was characterized using XRD using an Xpert Pro Materials Research Diffractometer (MRD) using Cu Kα1 radiation from a two bounce Ge (220) monochromator (λ = 1.6504 Å) and one-dimensional (1D) detector (PIXcel). Single-phase growth was confirmed by standard coupled θ-2θ scans, while the domain structure and lattice parameters were determined by reciprocal space maps (RSMs) near the 220c, 221c, and 310c SrTiO3 reflections (fig. S1). In the (110)c SrTiO3 orientation, only two ferroelastic domains are possible (with four total ferroelectric directions). The relative domain population of ferroelastic domains was determined by fitting 2D Gaussians to the BiFeO3 peaks in the RSM around the 221c SrTiO3 reflection (fig. S2). The film was thus determined to have a 99.5%/0.5% volume fraction, making, it in a practical sense, a single domain.",
      "Piezoresponse force microscopy",
      "PFM experiments were performed in a Nanoscope V multimode (Bruker) using an external ac source (DS360, Stanford Research) to excite the BiFeO3 thin film at a frequency of 35 kHz (far off resonance) with typical ac voltage excitations of 2 V peak to peak and external lock-in amplifiers (SR830, Standford Research). We used Cr/Pt-coated tips with a cantilever stiffness of 40 N/m. Two different orientations of the cantilever were used for the in-plane PFM measurements (Fig. 2, G and H) to characterize the in-plane domain structure of the films (fig. S3). The single ferroelectric domain could be switched with +7 V applied to the SrRuO3 electrode while scanning with the slow scan axis along [001]c, resulting in another single domain within the same ferroelastic domain (switching by 180°) (Fig. 2).",
      "Optical birefringence measurement",
      "The optical birefringence was measured in transmission geometry with a 400-nm laser [photon energy of 3.1 eV, above the bandgap of BiFeO3 to ensure absorption ] with an unfocused beam with a diameter of ~2 mm.",
      "Time-domain Brillouin light scattering",
      "Time-domain Brillouin light scattering was conducted at IMMM with a Ti:sapphire femtosecond laser oscillator. The oscillator delivered a 120-fs beam at 830 nm, which was split into two beams, the first (pump) being doubled in frequency (λpump = 415 nm) in a BaB2O4 crystal. The second beam (probe) is used to synchronously pump an optical parametric oscillator delivering a femtosecond laser beam in the visible range (λprobe = 587 nm) below the bandgap of BiFeO3, which permits the probe beam to penetrate in the film and in the substrate and hence to detect the propagating strain pulse. The transient optical reflectivity was measured through a balanced photodiode scheme. Under this condition, the optical detection process reveals only Brillouin components of the light-induced strain field. These Brillouin oscillation frequencies are given by  (for a probe beam with a normal incidence), where n is the refractive index of the probed medium and vs is the sound velocity (different for longitudinal or transverse acoustic modes).",
      "Time-resolved XRD",
      "The time-resolved XRD experiment was performed at the CRISTAL beamline of SOLEIL synchrotron. Optical excitation was achieved with 400-nm laser pulses of <80-fs duration as obtained by frequency doubling the fundamental output of the laser system (Micra oscillator and Legend Elite Duo HP amplifier, Coherent). The photo-induced lattice deformations were probed using x-rays of 7.082-keV energy, selected by means of a Si(111) double-crystal monochromator. The overall time-resolution of the experiment is set by the x-ray pulse duration, which is 10-ps full width at half maximum, as the storage ring was operated in the low-α mode. The pump beam irradiates nearly entirely the sample surface, while the probe x-ray beam is made at least twice smaller (maximum size of the x-ray footprint on sample: 90 μm by 500 μm). The various Bragg reflections studied were imaged using a photon-counting camera that was newly developed at SOLEIL, which enables simultaneous measurements at positive and negative pump-probe delays. Bragg reflections with high Miller indices (such as 403m and 530m) were chosen to increase the sensitivity of the measurement to the light-induced strain. The rocking curves were fitted with either one or two pseudo-Voigt functions.",
      "Light-induced strain calculations",
      "Light-induced strain calculations were done using the udkm1Dsim toolbox in Python, which simulates the thermal and the structural dynamics after light excitation of a 1D layered structure. The complete thermal and structural dynamics of the BiFeO3/SrRuO3/SrTiO3 nanostructure were modeled, although the strain of SrRuO3 layer is not displayed in the manuscript, especially in Fig. 3, as it is rather small. Further details can be found in note S3.",

      "STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY",
      "First trial to evaluate the benefits and harms of regularly testing care home staff for COVID-19 to protect residents from severe outcomes following infection.",
      "Process evaluation, economic and modelling analyses will provide insights into intervention feasibility and costs/cost-effectiveness, informing future public health policy.",
      "The study demonstrates the potential for large-scale trials in care homes that are delivered in partnership with care providers and capitalise on routinely collected data.",
      "The trial is being delivered in a rapidly changing policy and epidemiological context, which could undermine effective trial delivery.",
      "Introduction",
      "Context",
      "In England, approximately 380 000 people (4% of >65 years) live in 11 000 care homes for older adults. Most care home residents (‘residents’) are older than 85 years, at least two-thirds live with dementia, and over half die within 12 months of admission to a care home. Care home residents worldwide have experienced among the highest rates of COVID-19 mortality and morbidity, and in England, they have also been subject to particularly strict and lengthy lockdown measures. Prolonged use of COVID-19 restrictions (eg, social isolation, visitor restrictions) has had a devastating impact on residents’ well-being, and their physical and mental health, for example, depriving them of contact with family members in their final weeks of life.",
      "Current knowledge",
      "Public health disease control measures were deployed rapidly and simultaneously in care homes early in the pandemic to reduce infection spread, limiting any assessment of the impact of individual measures. There have been no interventional studies of non-pharmaceutical control measures to reduce COVID-19 infection in care homes, but a Cochrane rapid review (published in September 2021) identified 11 observational and 11 modelling studies, all from high-income countries. The review grouped interventions into entry regulations (eg, reducing visitors), contact regulating and transmission-reducing measures (eg, personal protective equipment), surveillance (symptomatic and asymptomatic testing) and outbreak control measures. Across these domains the quality of evidence was poor. In addition, there was widespread recognition that some of these measures, such as preventing visitors from entering the care home, were associated with significant harm.",
      "Throughout the pandemic, testing has been used in three ways to reduce transmission of infection: (1) symptomatic testing, (2) testing during outbreaks to reduce their duration and severity and (3) regular, asymptomatic testing.",
      "In the UK, compliance with regular testing may have been driven by national policies incentivising testing, including with financial support (eg, Adult Social Care Rapid Testing Fund introduced in January 2021, Infection Control Fund introduced May 2020). However, relatively few published studies have examined how these influence compliance with asymptomatic testing in care homes. We conducted a rapid systematic review, spanning January 2020 to July 2022. It highlighted 14 international papers, published in English. No studies used an experimental design, and none reported, or evaluated, interventions designed to improve compliance with SARS-CoV-2 testing. The papers used a range of designs (eg, qualitative, cross-sectional quantitative, consensus building). Together these studies highlight the multilevelled factors that have shaped adherence with SARS-CoV-2 testing in care homes. We then used the behaviour change wheel as an approach to develop systematically potentially useful intervention content from the factors influencing testing identified within the literature. Subsequently, through a series of stakeholder engagement events with diverse care home staff and representatives from the care home sector, we agreed the content of a multilevel intervention designed to maintain compliance with twice weekly lateral flow device (LFD) testing for COVID-19 within intervention care homes (‘Test to Care’).",
      "There remains a lack of evidence on whether the benefits of regular testing for COVID-19 outweigh its harms, and if so, under which scenarios. There have been no attempts in the literature to consolidate the considerable expertise and learning on how to ensure compliance with testing in this setting. From a policy perspective, the key question remains over appropriate thresholds for turning testing ‘on’ and ‘off’ in response to varying levels of ‘COVID-19 threat’ (eg, high/low levels of infection in the community; the emergence of novel COVID-19 variants).",
      "We posit that the best approach to address these questions is through a randomised clinical trial. Randomisation overcomes the problem of substantial heterogeneity among care homes as they vary in resident population, care provision and uptake of control measures such as vaccination in staff or use of facemasks, which limit the conclusions that can be drawn from observational studies. Although there are significant challenges associated with undertaking a trial in care homes in a changing policy and epidemiological context, there is an urgent need for high-quality evidence to inform the future use of testing for SARS-CoV-2 and potentially other infections in this setting.",
      "Study aims",
      "We will investigate whether continued use of regular asymptomatic testing in staff is a feasible, effective and cost-effective strategy to reduce the impact of COVID-19 in care homes. Findings will inform testing policy across the UK for COVID-19 and add to knowledge on the use of testing in care homes to prevent other respiratory viruses, such as influenza. These objectives will be delivered through a series of five interlinked work packages (WPs), which are described in detail in online supplemental file 1.",
      "Methods and analysis",
      "Study design",
      "VIVALDI-Clinical Trial (VIVALDI-CT) is a multicentre, open-label, cluster randomised controlled, phase III/IV superiority trial.",
      "Each eligible care home will be randomised to either standard care (SARS-CoV-2 testing policy for care home staff that is in place nationally at the time of trial operation), or regular asymptomatic testing of care home staff for COVID-19 using LFDs combined with support payments for sickness absence and agency staff backfill.",
      "Study setting",
      "VIVALDI-CT will take place in up to 280 residential and/or nursing homes in England providing care to adults aged >65 years.",
      "Recruitment",
      "Due to rapid timescales for trial delivery, and the need to streamline and centralise data collection, we will primarily partner with providers that manage multiple care homes. We will first contact the senior management teams of providers that we have previously worked with in the Vivaldi study to determine if they are interested in trial participation. Providers will be asked to supply a list of eligible care homes and confirm that the care home manager has provided consent for each listed home to participate. If we are unable to recruit sufficient homes from the Vivaldi network, we will work with provider representative organisations (eg, National Care Forum, Care England, National Care Association) to identify other eligible providers.",
      "Homes will be selected to capture diversity in care home size, population (nursing/residential/dementia care), ethnicity, geographical location, rural/urban and provider type (for-profit/not-for-profit). Inclusive participation will be a focus by ensuring larger and smaller care groups are included in trial, as well as focusing on diverse settings.",
      "Inclusion and exclusion criteria",
      "Only care home staff are eligible to participate in the testing intervention. This includes temporary (agency) staff with no restrictions, that is, catering, administrative and maintenance staff, in addition to those in a resident-facing role. However, all care home staff, as well as residents, visitors and relatives, are eligible to participate in interviews undertaken as part of the trial’s process evaluation. All care home residents at participating homes are eligible for data collection and analysis of the outcomes specified.",
      "Visitors, residents and relatives are not eligible to take part in the testing intervention. Staff who visit the care home to provide care but are not employed by the care home, for example, General Practitioners (GPs), health visitors, are not eligible to take part in either the interviews or the testing intervention.",
      "Primary outcome",
      "The primary outcome is the incidence of COVID-19-related hospital admissions in residents defined as admissions with a relevant International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th revision (ICD-10) code (COVID-19 hospitalisations to be defined as any hospital admission record with a primary or secondary ICD-10 code of ‘U071’) and/or admissions in residents who test positive for COVID-19 within 24 hours following admission or in the 7 days before hospital admission. This is considered the most important outcome for policy-makers.",
      "Secondary outcomes",
      "Although we have adopted a healthcare/National Health Service (NHS) perspective for the primary outcome, we recognise the importance of capturing outcomes that are relevant to the social care sector, such as outbreaks and care home closures. This is reflected in our choice of secondary outcomes:",

      "The impact of testing on resident, staff and visitors, for example, social care-related quality of life collected via interviews in WP3.",
      "Sample size",
      "Based on observational data from the VIVALDI study, we found that over the 3-month period of January–March 2022, 1.8% of residents had a COVID-19-related hospital admission, and the intracluster correlation (ICC) across homes was 0.003 (95% CI 0.000 to 0.007). We assume that we will observe a cumulative incidence of around 3.0% in the trial, which would require a trial duration of 5–6 months if the incidence rate is similar to that in winter 2021/2022, in combination with a conservative ICC value of up to 0.01 (higher in line with the higher cumulative incidence compared with 3 months), and an average care home size of 35 residents with coefficient of variation in size of 0.5. With a total of 280 homes randomised 1:1 to trial arms and taking the usual two-sided test at 5% significance level, the design provides 84% power to detect a reduction in COVID-19-related admissions due to intervention to 1.9% (relative risk 0.63).",
      "Timeline",
      "The trial programme will run from November 2022 to April 2024. The recruitment of care home providers and operation of the intervention will take place between December 2022 and March 2023, with the possibility that this will be extended if deemed necessary for data collection. Online supplemental file 2 shows a participant timeline and figure 1 is a schematic of the trial pathway.",

      "Intervention allocation",
      "Care homes will be randomised on a 1:1 ratio. If all providers are ready for trial participation at the same time, then all participating homes will be randomised at the same time. Otherwise, the homes from different providers will be randomised in a phased approach, as they become ready. Randomisation will be performed by the trial statistician based on pseudorandom number generation after trial enrolment and before intervention implementation. Restricted randomisation (specifically covariate constrained randomisation) will be used to ensure balance on care home provider, size and region.",
      "Blinding",
      "Researchers and staff of participating care homes will not be blinded to their intervention allocation, as this would not be feasible.",
      "Data collection",
      "To facilitate trial setup and minimise the burden on care home staff, much of the data for analysis will be obtained from routinely collected healthcare information held within the UK COVID-19 Datastore. This will include results of LFD and PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 for staff and residents, information on hospital admissions and deaths for residents, and vaccination history for residents. Data within the COVID-19 Datastore are linked to a pseudonymised ID at the level of each individual, which can be linked to care quality commission-ID (CQC-ID), a unique ID number provided by the CQC to identify each care home, for participating care homes and associated staff or resident status. A new study-specific pseudonymised ID will be created for each individual before export of data to University College London (UCL), in order to prevent any theoretical possibility of reidentification.",
      "Hospital admissions data are linked to ICD-10 diagnostic codes (including COVID-19 codes); however, there is a lag of several months in the assignment of these codes. To allow timely monitoring of data quality for the primary outcome and limit the risk of omitting or double-counting hospital admissions in residents, during the intervention period providers will be asked to upload weekly lists of COVID-19-associated hospital admissions in residents from participating care homes to the COVID-19 Datastore. Linkage to individual pseudonymised IDs will allow comparison to the routinely collected hospital admission data once available.",
      "To inform estimates of incidence rates which form the primary and secondary outcomes, we will collect the total number of residents in the home on a weekly basis from providers as this will allow us to estimate the denominator. We will also collect the total number of staff on a weekly basis from each home to inform estimates of testing uptake and explore the feasibility of collecting data on the number of staff who opt-out of asymptomatic testing (in the intervention arm).",
      "Care home level (aggregate) data will be collected from providers on dates of care home closures, use of disease control measures, staff sickness absence and employment of agency staff to inform health economic analyses. We will explore the feasibility of collecting care home level data on fees paid by residents who are funded by the local authority, and whether it is feasible to collect more detailed information on healthcare utilisation, such as primary care consultations and use of antivirals in residents.",
      "Data on outbreak events (dates, size) will be obtained from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) Adult Social Care Team. Data on the local incidence of COVID-19 and cocirculation of other respiratory viruses will be obtained from the UKHSA and/or the Office of National Statistics Covid Infection Survey.",
      "Data management",
      "Individual-level trial data will be stored in the UCL Data Safe Haven, which is hosted by UCL. All identifiable data will be held only by individual care homes or NHS England (NHSE), who will act as data processor on behalf of UCL. These databases are protected by multilayer firewalls with full data encryption at rest and in transit.",
      "For qualitative interviews, data collection will occur remotely using secure communication methods and be conducted by University of Strathclyde (UoS) researchers. On completion of transcription at UoS, the pseudoanonymised data will be stored on the UoS network in a secure, restricted access folder for 5 years from the time of end of trial. Raw data will be destroyed once transcription and quality checks have been performed. Consent forms obtained via interviews and focus groups in the process evaluation will also be stored securely.",
      "Statistical analysis",
      "Analysis of the primary outcome, and secondary outcomes expressed as event incidence, will be based on Poisson or negative binomial regression with cluster-robust SEs, adjusting for calendar time and key care home characteristics used in the restricted randomisation such as provider, region and size. We will also explore whether the intervention effect differs according to care home size, and other characteristics such as proportion of temporary staff. Unadjusted effect estimates from these analyses will be reported for completeness. Using interaction terms, we will explore whether the effect of the intervention on the primary outcome differed between time periods defined by the national recommendations for testing in the routine care arm, should these change during data collection.",
      "Analysis of the primary outcome will include all trial care homes (intention-to-treat analysis), and so represent a treatment policy estimand. We will also define an implementation score based on the frequency and proportion of staff testing at each home based on data the homes provide, which may vary over time. As an exploratory analysis we will assess whether the primary outcome is associated with this implementation score within the intervention arm and express the effect of the intervention relative to control arm for different levels of implementation. This analysis will be based on the same regression method as used for the primary analysis.",
      "Health economic analysis",
      "The health economic analysis will investigate the cost-effectiveness and cost consequences of the testing intervention taking an NHS, personal social services and a societal perspective using a lifetime horizon (according to care home resident average age and life expectancy). The within-trial costs and outcomes in intervention and control groups will be examined from each perspective. Cost-effectiveness of the intervention in terms of the primary outcome and in terms of all-cause mortality will also be examined. Costs of admission will be excluded from the total costs under consideration in this case.",
      "We will also examine cost-effectiveness in terms of the secondary outcomes of cases prevented and resident deaths prevented, and outcomes of hospital admission and number of outbreaks alongside costs offset/additional costs incurred in a cost–consequences analysis.",
      "Process evaluation",
      "There is major diversity across care homes, for example, in terms of provision of care, resident population, care home size and the care home workforce. As a result, it is essential to consider the feasibility and sustainability of the intervention and how contextual factors might impact on the ability to scale it, if the trial suggests it is effective and cost-effective. These issues will be addressed in the process evaluation, which aims to understand intervention roll out and identify areas for optimisation to inform future intervention scale-up, should the testing approach prove effective and cost-effective.",
      "The objectives of the process evaluation are as follows:",
      "To determine intervention acceptability.",
      "To determine the role of context in shaping the way, the intervention operated.",
      "To determine what can be learned about intervention fidelity and adaptation.",
      "To determine which intervention components worked as anticipated and which need further modification.",
      "To investigate unanticipated intervention effects.",
      "To determine what can be learned from the control group.",
      "The process evaluation will develop implementation guidance and training packages ready for future scale up as well as details of minimal care home requirements and staff competencies necessary for intervention delivery.",
      "Qualitative data will be collected from 28 (10%) care homes evenly distributed across each intervention and control arms and spaced across time.",
      "Patient and public involvement",
      "Patient and public involvement (PPI) has already informed the development of this programme, by highlighting the barriers to testing and the need to capture its adverse impacts on staff, residents and providers. Public advisors have also emphasised the importance of developing a strong plan for implementation, recognising the financial implications of long-term use of testing and sickness payments, informing our emphasis on implementation in WP5.",
      "The PPI team will deliver the following objectives:",
      "To ensure that the ‘voice and views’ of the public regarding regular testing for COVID-19 are heard by the research team and the wider stakeholder group.",
      "To create an open, inclusive culture enabling effective communication between the study team, PPI group and the wider stakeholder and oversight groups.",

      "An independent trial steering committee (TSC) and data monitoring and ethics committee (DMEC) will be formally responsible for programme oversight, ensuring the study is conducted in compliance with regulations. The DMEC will also be responsible for monitoring the accumulating data and making recommendations to the TSC on whether the trial should continue as planned.",
      "A trial management group will be responsible for the design, coordination and strategic management of the trial.",
      "Safety reporting",
      "Staff at the sites randomised to asymptomatic testing will report the occurrence of serious adverse events (SAEs) considered ‘related’ to the intervention only. In such cases, site personnel will complete an SAE report within 24 hours of notification of the event. Clinical review of any SAEs will take place and be reported to the Research Ethics Committee if deemed both ‘related’ to the trial intervention and ‘unexpected’ in line with UK Health Research Authority (HRA) non-drug trial reporting requirements.",
      "Research ethics approval",
      "The study has been approved by the London—Bromley Research Ethics Committee (reference number 22/LO/0846) and the HRA (22/CAG/0165).",
      "Consent and opt-out",
      "Care home providers and home managers will be asked if their care home(s) are willing to participate in the trial. High staff turnover, in conjunction with the large number of care homes participating in the trial, means that it is not feasible to obtain individual consent from staff or regarding the use of testing data. Staff and residents have the option of opting out from the processing and analysis of their individual-level data within this study at any time during the study.",
      "Identifiable data submitted by care homes as part of the study will be pseudonymised by NHSE before it is provided to the research team. This study has section 251 support to allow the disclosure of confidential patient information (regarding testing in staff) from care homes to NHSE, for the purposes of monitoring uptake of the testing in the control and intervention arms of the trial.",
      "The study will also collect limited individual-level identifiable data from residents to ensure the primary outcome can be determined accurately. It is not feasible to seek individual-level consent from every resident for the use of these data due to high levels of cognitive impairment in residents and excluding data from a large proportion of residents would compromise the scientific value of the trial and the subsequent generalisability of trial findings. This study has section 251 support to allow the disclosure of confidential patient information (regarding residents admitted to hospital) from care homes to NHSE, for the purposes of linkage to the COVID-19 datastore and to enable NHSE to use confidential patient information from SARS-CoV-2 tests to link to other NHS datasets within the COVID-19 datastore.",
      "Care home managers in the subset of homes selected for qualitative data collection (focus groups or one to one interviews) will be asked to disseminate recruitment materials to staff within the home via word of mouth, email, or other routine modes of communication. On receipt of staff contact details, interested staff will then be sent participant information sheets about the study, given the option to ask questions about the study, complete on-line consent forms and provide brief sociodemographic details to enable the study team to monitor total sample composition. Having checked on-line consent has already been given and after exploring any remaining unanswered questions raised by the Participant Information Sheets (PIS), the participants will be asked to also give recorded oral consent to participate.",
      "Confidentiality",
      "All data will be handled in accordance with the Data Protection Act 2018, the UK General Data Protection Regulation and subsequent updates and amendments.",
      "Dissemination policy",

      "A lay summary of the results will also be produced to disseminate the results to participants. A summary of results will be included online in the publicly accessible HRA website within 12 months of the date of trial closure. A statistical analysis plan will also be published under open access arrangements.",
      "Discussion",
      "The proposed research faces several specific methodological and operational challenges, primarily because the study is being conducted at pace in a dynamic epidemiological and policy context. We outline the main challenges and potential mitigations here.",
      "In designing this trial, we worked closely with care home staff and providers to design a testing intervention that would be feasible and acceptable. In particular, we worked closely with each care provider participating in the study to understand how they process and organise sick pay and employ agency staff and the likely costs. We met with the providers’ Human Resources (HR) teams and also members of their senior management team. We established a flexible approach to reimbursing sick pay and agency staff to ensure all legitimate costs will be covered. Providers will be asked to provide evidence of the actual costs accrued each month and this will be verified by the funder before payments are released, ensuring that compensation for staff sickness is adequate.",
      "We have also organised a series of stakeholder engagement events with diverse care home staff and representatives from the care home sector to agree the content of the intervention, which has been designed to maintain compliance with testing and ensure staff in intervention care homes will not be disadvantaged. Engagement events have included consideration of testing acceptability, how to increase uptake of testing and logistics related to support payments, such as when and how they should be paid to staff. These events will also provide an opportunity to discuss concerns related to potential consequences for staff and organisations as a result of participating in the trial. All these issues were taken into account when designing the testing protocol and associated support payments. Care home staff in participating care homes were noted to be extremely familiar with the process of regular asymptomatic testing and reimbursement of sick pay as this was in place throughout the pandemic in England.",
      "There is a significant question over whether the trial will be sufficiently powered to detect a statistically significant outcome. This is predicated on both the epidemiological event rate during the intervention period, and willingness of sufficient numbers of care homes to participate.",
      "We are acutely aware that there is a risk that rates of COVID-19 might decline from estimates used from previous years (making it impossible to achieve significance for the primary outcome), but we have taken the view that this is unique opportunity to try to generate data on the effectiveness, benefits and harms of regularly testing asymptomatic staff for COVID-19 (with financial support for staff sickness and agency staff backfill) to prevent severe outcomes in residents, which would be lost if we did not attempt this trial. At the time of trial design and the application for funding (August 2022), it was very unclear whether there would be a resurgence of COVID-19 in autumn/winter associated with the emergence of a new variant.",
      "In the event that the trial’s primary outcome cannot be delivered as planned, the non-trial WPs will still generate valuable evidence to inform future use of testing in care homes, by characterising barriers and facilitators to testing, estimating costs of the testing intervention and generating models that can be used to estimate the impact of testing on infections and hospital admissions under different epidemiological scenarios.",
      "While we considered including testing for visitors as part of the intervention, this would have introduced further complexity regarding consent. It would also have strayed from the approach that was adopted during the pandemic in England, which is what we wanted to evaluate.",
      "We note that results of a trial investigating the benefits of COVID-19-related staff testing and sickness support payments in a care home context would have been beneficial earlier in the course of the pandemic. The challenge in trying to do this has been that it would have been extremely difficult to persuade public health agencies (in the UK or elsewhere) that it was reasonable to withhold regular asymptomatic testing in control homes when there were high levels of COVID-19 transmission in the community. We feel it remains a highly salient research question and the results should help inform policy for care home preparedness, both in relation to COVID-19 but also in support of future research into wider institutional infectious disease transmission mitigation.",
      "While there are significant methodological challenges to conducting this study, it is our view that we need to learn how to do trials at pace and scale in care homes, to improve the quality of care for residents. In addition to generating important evidence on the effectiveness, benefits and harms of asymptomatic testing for COVID-19 in staff to prevent severe outcomes in residents, this trial will provide important learning to inform the design and delivery of future care home trials.",

Validation of the diagnostic procedure (e.g., imaging), diagnosis, and treatment recommendation allows oncological therapy to be applied in a more targeted way, optimizing interdisciplinary care. This study describes patients who received second opinions at the Comprehensive Cancer Center for Erlangen–Nuremberg metropolitan area in Germany over a 6-year period, as well as the amount of time spent on second-opinion counseling. Methods: This prospective, descriptive, single-center observational study included 584 male and female cancer patients undergoing gynecological, urologic, or general surgery who sought a second medical opinion. The extent to which the first opinion complied with standard guidelines was assessed solely descriptively. Results: The first opinion was in accordance with the guidelines and complete in 54.5% of the patients, and guideline compliant but incomplete in 13.2%. The median time taken to form a second opinion was 225 min, and the cancer information service was contacted by patients an average of eight times. Conclusions: The initial opinion was guideline compliant and complete in every second case. Without a second opinion, the remaining patients would have been denied a guideline-compliant treatment recommendation. Obtaining a second opinion gives patients an opportunity to receive a guideline-compliant treatment recommendation and enables them to benefit from newer, individualized therapeutic approaches in clinical trials.

      "1. Introduction",
      "Numerous national and international guidelines are available for diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up for most cancer entities. Adherence to evidence-based guidelines offers clear benefits to patients, as it is associated with an improved outcome. A guideline-compliant diagnosis for each patient is a prerequisite for being able to offer guideline-compliant therapy. Structurally standardized procedures already start with the assessment of early findings and precursor lesions, such as those in the breast or cervix.",
      "The provision of oncological therapy in specialized cancer centers has also demonstrated an enhanced outcome for patients with various types of cancer.",
      "However, the proportion of patients who receive treatment in accordance with oncological guidelines is not known. Not every patient is able to attend a specialized oncological center for various reasons, such as a lack of awareness regarding their availability or the distances required to travel to the specialized center.",
      "The opportunity to obtain a second opinion on medical issues is currently becoming increasingly important given the availability of new, individualized treatment options and the patients’ capacities to independently seek information about cancer treatment, particularly through the Internet. The advantages of a second opinion include obtaining information about modern and more experimental treatment options and improving the quality and cost-effectiveness of cancer care.",
      "The benefits of seeking a second opinion and the underlying motivations are subjects of ongoing research. Seeking a second opinion is associated with the avoidance of both overtreatment and undertreatment. Patient satisfaction is reported to be significantly higher in patients who seek a second opinion, as it often leads to improved diagnosis and/or treatment. The motivations for seeking a second opinion have also been investigated; in 70% of cases, patients seek more information and/or reassurance after receiving the initial treatment recommendation. There is a strong correlation between disease-related fear or distress and patients seeking a second opinion.",
      "The legal requirements for obtaining a second medical opinion in Germany are governed by the Law on Improving Statutory Health Insurance Care (GKV-Versorgungsstärkungsgesetz, 2015), and regulations on centers providing such second opinions apply, affecting reimbursement by health insurance companies. Under the statutory health insurance system in Bavaria (Allgemeine Ortskrankenkasse, AOK, Munich, Germany), insured individuals can obtain a second medical opinion for oncological diseases via an interdisciplinary tumor board. The pilot project investigated in the present study was initiated pursuant to the German Social Security Code, Book V, Section 63, paragraph 1.",
      "Research has shown that cancer patients experience a better outcome when treated in accordance with national guidelines and national treatment recommendations based on the latest developments in clinical trials. The aim of this prospective study of cancer patients seeking a second opinion was therefore to analyze whether the first opinion that they had received was in accordance with national guidelines.",
      "2. Materials and Methods",
      "Eligible patients included men and women who used the AOK (statutory health insurance) service number to contact the cancer information service at Erlangen University Hospital and received a second opinion regarding their cancer therapy. Patients were only included if they had never been admitted to Erlangen University Hospital for this specific type of tumor and had had no outpatient contact with the hospital within the last 3 months. Cancer patients in the fields of urology, gynecology, gastroenterology, and sarcomas were included. This is due to the high caseload in these areas and the presence of specific, validated “Level 3” (evidence-based and consensus-based) national guidelines. Exclusion criteria encompassed patients who contacted the service number for reasons unrelated to seeking a second oncological opinion, patients who did not provide their full cancer history, and patients with malignancies other than in the fields of urology, gynecology, gastroenterology, or sarcoma.",
      "Patient recruitment took place between 1 June 2014, and 31 May 2020. A total of 584 patients met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis (Figure 1).",
      "2.1. Study Design",
      "The study procedure was conducted in the following manner: Initially, all patients who contacted the cancer information service via the AOK service number were documented. The patients’ characteristics and their clinical reports were collected during the initial contact—e.g., gender and age as well as the cancer diagnosis. A complete list is provided in Appendix A. The method of counseling offered (by phone, in writing, etc.) and the duration of contact were also documented.",
      "Upon obtaining written consent from the patients, their cases were presented to the interdisciplinary tumor board. The tumor board’s recommendation was then documented on a second opinion form, and the extent of guideline compliance with the first opinion treatment recommendation was assessed. A form stating the interdisciplinary tumor board’s recommendation was sent to the patients. If any questions or uncertainties arose thereafter, patients were able to contact the Comprehensive Cancer Center once again.",
      "After 3 months, follow-up inquiries were made concerning the patient’s current treatment status. If this information was not assessable, the reason for this was identified and documented if possible—e.g., because the patient had died or had withdrawn consent. Based on the information obtained, the extent of the patient’s adherence to the recommendations offered in the second opinion was assessed (this will be reported on elsewhere).",
      "2.2. Data Acquisition",
      "Patients’ approaches to second opinions. All patients who used the AOK (statutory health insurance) hotline to contact the cancer information service affiliated with the Comprehensive Cancer Center (CCC) for the Erlangen–Nuremberg metropolitan area were documented. During the initial contact, patient characteristics were recorded, including the patient’s gender, age, cancer diagnosis, and tumor stage, at the time of the inquiry. The complete data file is attached in Appendix A. The duration of the phone call was documented. Subsequently, CCC staff sent the patients a consent form and a questionnaire for the second opinion, and the patient was registered with the relevant department’s interdisciplinary tumor board.",
      "Presentation at the interdisciplinary tumor board. The patient’s case was presented in the relevant interdisciplinary tumor conference, which includes various disciplines—e.g., gynecology, urology, gastroenterology, pathology, radiology, general surgery, medical oncology, and radiotherapy. Treatment recommendations were discussed on an interdisciplinary basis and were aligned with the standards of the “Level 3” (evidence-based and consensus-based) national guidelines—e.g., for breast, cervical, or vulvar cancer, colorectal cancer, or prostate cancer. The tumor board’s treatment decision and the consistency of the initial recommendation with the national guidelines were documented. Subsequently, all patients received a letter stating the tumor board’s decision. If there were any remaining questions or uncertainties, the patients were able to contact the CCC once again.",
      "Assessing the degree of agreement between the first and second opinions. The extent of agreement between the first and second opinions was exclusively assessed for patients in the gynecology, urology, and surgery departments included in the study. This evaluation of the agreement was undertaken by two medical experts. In the event of discrepancies between the two assessors, the decision of the more experienced assessor was used on the basis of his or her clinical experience.",
      "2.3. Ethics",
      "This study was approved by the Ethics Committee at Erlangen University Hospital (no. 175_13B) and was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles set out in the Declaration of Helsinki.",
      "2.4. Statistical Analysis",
      "Guideline compliance and time spent on second opinion counseling were evaluated descriptively, with frequencies and percentages. Statistical tests were not performed since no group comparisons or interventions were performed. All statistical analyses were performed using the R statistical software package (version 3.6.1, 2019; R Core Team, Vienna, Austria).",
      "3. Results",
      "3.1. Patient Group",
      "A total of 2342 patients contacted the AOK (statutory health insurance) service number. Among these, 1500 patients received information about a second opinion; the remaining calls were made for various reasons—e.g., a change of address or loss of the patient’s insurance card. Ultimately, 705 patients received a second opinion. The remaining patients did not receive a second opinion—for example, because they did not submit any documents. Among the 705 patients who received a second opinion, 586 had cases relevant for the tumor conferences on gynecological, urological, or gastroenterological cancers or sarcoma that were participating in the analysis. Two patients were excluded due to missing information in the main variables. Figure 1 provides a comprehensive breakdown of the patient recruitment process.",
      "3.2. Patient Characteristics",
      "The mean age of the 584 patients with malignancies in the fields of gynecology, urology, gastroenterology, or sarcoma was 61 years (standard deviation of 12.3 years). Among these, 59% of the patients were women (n = 343), and 41% were men (n = 238).",
      "The primary diagnosis showed no distant metastases in 32.9% of cases (n = 188); 17% of the patients (n = 97) had distant metastases. The patients were free of tumors in 18.6% of cases (n = 106). At the time of consultation, most patients had not yet received any treatment, but treatment was planned in 76.1% (n = 392). Primary therapy was being administered to 17% (n = 99), and 13.4% (n = 78) of the patients were undergoing palliative therapy (Table 1).",
      "The characteristics of all the patients in all departments (n = 705) are shown in Table 2.",
      "3.3. Guideline Compliance of the First Opinion",
      "For a total of 584 patients seeking a second opinion in the fields of gynecology, urology, or general surgery, the initial opinion was found to be guideline compliant and complete in 54.5% of cases (n = 318). The initial opinion was guideline compliant but incomplete in 13.2% (n = 77). Guideline compliance was not assessable—e.g., due to missing data—in 12.8% (n = 75) of cases, and guidelines were not available for less common tumor entities in 11.5% of cases. The first opinion was found not to be in accordance with the guidelines in 6.8% of cases (n = 40). There was no information regarding the tumor entity, or the tumor entity was not part of the evaluation in 1.2% of cases (n = 7) (Table 3).",
      "3.4. Time Required until a Second Opinion Is Formed",
      "Figure 2 shows the distribution of the total time needed for second opinion counseling. The mean total time needed was 239.8 min (standard deviation: 60.4 min), and the median was 225 min (interquartile range: 200–260 min). In the fastest case, a second opinion took 140 min. In the longest case, 780 min were needed for second-opinion counseling (Table 4). Registration for the tumor board, which was performed by the cancer information staff, took 120 min in each case.",
      "Each patient contact (e.g., in the form of a telephone call or also a written contact) was evaluated as an action, and registration for the interdisciplinary tumor board or the receipt or dispatch of documents was also evaluated as an action.",
      "4. Discussion",
      "The aim of this prospective study of cancer patients seeking a second opinion was to analyze whether the first opinion they had received was in accordance with national guidelines. The initial opinion was found to be guideline-compliant and complete in every second case. Without a second opinion, a guideline-compliant treatment recommendation would have been denied to the remaining patients.",
      "Second medical opinions can have a substantial influence on cancer patients’ well-being, treatment, and prognosis. The present study was initiated in order to examine the quality and effectiveness of care for oncological patients during the process of obtaining a second medical opinion through the AOK second opinion project. The report includes the largest group of cancer patients in Germany investigated to date concerning second opinions in Germany.",
      "In the past, observations on second opinions have often focused on interobserver variability of diagnostic procedures, such as histological processing with molecular markers, pathological risk factors, or imaging. In today’s clinical routine, most oncological therapy recommendations are generated in interdisciplinary tumor conferences, renowned for their enhancement of patient care and treatment planning. Investigating therapy recommendations is thus an important aspect of health economics and health-care research.",
      "Few data are available on patient-initiated second medical opinions. One of the greatest obstacles that patients face when seeking a second opinion is managing the doctor–patient relationship. A novel approach used in the present trial was that patients were able to request a second opinion through the mediation of the health insurance company, independently of traditional face-to-face consultations. This approach may lower the barrier to seeking a second opinion and does not involve any personal costs for patients, such as transportation to the hospital. In addition, having an objective, neutral point of contact accessible by phone makes the second opinion easily available and can break down psychological barriers for both patients and oncologists.",
      "From the perspective of insurance companies, second opinions serve as valuable tools for providing objective quality assurance. As this study shows, second opinions are more likely to lead to guideline-compliant recommendations, improving the quality and cost-effectiveness of the treatment.",
      "In Germany, the certification procedures for oncological cancer centers require clinical trials to be available for patients. Patients are therefore more likely to be able to participate in clinical trials in certified oncological cancer centers. This access affords them the opportunity to receive individualized treatments, including targeted and/or immune therapies, which can contribute to long-term advancements in medical care.",
      "The results of this study are consistent with our group’s previously published data on patient-initiated second opinions. However, it is important to note that the data in the present study encompassed a broader spectrum of oncology patients and included individuals from various oncological centers, yielding similar outcomes.",
      "A previous study reported a higher proportion of first opinions that were in accordance with national guidelines, at 72.2%. Potential reasons for the discrepancy may include different groups of patients since only those with breast cancer were included. Cancer guidelines and certified cancer centers were first established in the field of gynecology for breast cancer. Also, breast cancer therapy is more standardized than for rarer gynecological and other cancers.",
      "Without a second opinion, one-third of the patients would not have had access to fully guideline-compliant treatment recommendations, potentially leading to poorer outcomes, higher costs, and less patient satisfaction. This highlights the need for second opinions issued by qualified interdisciplinary tumor boards, and it also justifies the necessary costs for staffing and infrastructure involved in providing a second opinion. The availability of guideline-compliant treatment could potentially improve an easy-to-access method for initiating and obtaining a second opinion. Examples of accessibility with no personal presentation at the hospital could be by phone or writing, as reported in this study, or an app-based tool. This approach could effectively reduce barriers for patients seeking second opinions, as it does not incur any costs and requires only a minimal time commitment from the patients.",
      "Regarding the patient group, the gender distribution was uneven; 59% of the patients were women. This suggests that women give greater attention to medical concerns and raises the possibility of a potential disadvantage for male patients in patient-initiated healthcare approaches.",
      "An analysis of the patients’ different therapy situations showed that individuals seek second opinions across all stages of treatment. The timing of these consultations was mostly during diagnosis and prior to the initiation of therapy, but also during treatment. The duration and timing of seeking a second opinion are therefore critical factors to consider, as they can impact the commencement of therapy, leading to a potential increase in mortality.",
      "The strong demand for second opinions was observed in patients with previous treatment and/or metastases. This underlines the need for second opinions in advanced therapy lines when clinical guidelines offer multiple (chemo)therapeutic options, and suitable therapy recommendations are especially crucial for individual patients. The demand for second opinions was also substantial both before and during new treatments, either to confirm the current therapy or to have validated therapy recommendations for the subsequent treatment.",
      "The sometimes large expenditure of time required until a second opinion is obtained is justified in any case if it results in a guideline-compliant therapy recommendation for the patient.",
      "Strengths and Limitations",
      "This study includes the largest cohort of patients seeking a second opinion that has been investigated to date in Germany, with different tumor entities from different oncological centers (urology, gastroenterology, gynecology, and sarcoma).",
      "The limitations of the analysis include the degree of comparability of this patient population with those described in other studies. All included patients were in the same insurance class, well informed about the option of requesting a second opinion through the insurance company, and mostly in adequate health. The second opinion in this study was patient-initiated and therefore do not include certain cohorts, such as patients with poorer health status. For the latter group, it is known that patients who rate their health status as severe are less likely to participate in research surveys. However, for such patients with considerable periods of previous treatment, therapy recommendations are challenging, and a second opinion could be especially beneficial.",
      "The patterns and outcomes of second opinions may vary in different patient populations. For example, patients with private health insurance, those who are less well informed, and those in poorer health may offer different results. Nonetheless, this study offers novel and clinically relevant information on cancer patients seeking a second opinion as well as on decision-making in cancer treatment.",
      "Furthermore, another limitation of this study lies in the absence of a more detailed description of pathological and clinical features. While our research has examined and elucidated various aspects of second opinions in cancer patients, this omission is a result of a deliberate focus on broader patterns and mechanisms. The findings presented herein are limited in their scope and do not provide insights into the pathological underpinnings that may be relevant in certain contexts.",
      "5. Conclusions",
      "Every oncological patient has the right to seek a second medical opinion, which often provides added value for the patient’s treatments. Obtaining a second opinion offers patients the opportunity to receive a guideline-compliant therapy recommendation and to benefit from new treatment approaches within the framework of clinical studies. It can, however, be a time-consuming process for both patients and oncological staff.",
      "This study presents research on patient-initiated second opinions and includes a large group of oncological patients with different malignancies, thanks to cooperation between three oncological centers in the fields of urology, general surgery, and gynecology. The easy-to-access method for obtaining a second opinion reported in this study could potentially improve the availability of guideline-compliant therapy.",
      "Healthcare providers should not discourage cancer patients from exploring the option of seeking a second opinion, particularly in cases involving complex therapy decisions, prior treatment history, or metastases. These results emphasize the need for accessible methods for obtaining second opinions, which can contribute to the availability of guideline-compliant treatments.",
      "Future research endeavors should focus on assessing patients’ adherence to second opinions and understanding the factors influencing their decisions to seek or not seek such consultations.",

      "Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are associated with attentional impairments, with both commonalities and differences in the nature of their attention deficits. This study aimed to investigate the neural correlates of ADHD and ASD traits in healthy individuals, focusing on the functional connectivity (FC) of attention-related large-scale brain networks (LSBNs). The participants were 61 healthy individuals (30 men; age, 21.9 ± 1.9 years). The Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS) and Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) were administered as indicators of ADHD and ASD traits, respectively. Performance in the continuous performance test (CPT) was used as a behavioural measure of sustained attentional function. Functional magnetic resonance imaging scans were performed during the resting state (Rest) and auditory oddball task (Odd). Considering the critical role in attention processing, we focused our analyses on the default mode (DMN), frontoparietal (FPN), and salience (SN) networks. Region of interest (ROI)-to-ROI analyses (false discovery rate < 0.05) were performed to determine relationships between psychological measures with within-network FC (DMN, FPN, and SN) as well as with between-network FC (DMN-FPN, DMN-SN, and FPN-SN). ASRS scores, but not AQ scores, were correlated with less frequent commission errors and shorter reaction times in the CPT. During Odd, significant positive correlations with ASRS were demonstrated in multiple FCs within DMN, while significant positive correlations with AQ were demonstrated in multiple FCs within FPN. AQs were negatively correlated with FPN-SN FCs. During Rest, AQs were negatively and positively correlated with one FC within the SN and multiple FCs between the DMN and SN, respectively. These findings of the ROI-to-ROI analysis were only partially replicated in a split-half replication analysis, a replication analysis with open-access data sets, and a replication analysis with a structure-based atlas. The better CPT performance by individuals with subclinical ADHD traits suggests positive effects of these traits on sustained attention. Differential associations between LSBN FCs and ASD/ADHD traits corroborate the notion of differences in sustained and selective attention between clinical ADHD and ASD."

This study aimed to investigate the neural correlates of ADHD and ASD traits in healthy individuals, focusing on the functional connectivity (FC) of attention-related large-scale brain networks (LSBNs). The participants were 61 healthy individuals (30 men; age, 21.9 ± 1.9 years). The Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS) and Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) were administered as indicators of ADHD and ASD traits, respectively. Performance in the continuous performance test (CPT) was used as a behavioural measure of sustained attentional function. Functional magnetic resonance imaging scans were performed during the resting state (Rest) and auditory oddball task (Odd). Considering the critical role in attention processing, we focused our analyses on the default mode (DMN), frontoparietal (FPN), and salience (SN) networks. Region of interest (ROI)-to-ROI analyses (false discovery rate < 0.05) were performed to determine relationships between psychological measures with within-network FC (DMN, FPN, and SN) as well as with between-network FC (DMN-FPN, DMN-SN, and FPN-SN). ASRS scores, but not AQ scores, were correlated with less frequent commission errors and shorter reaction times in the CPT. During Odd, significant positive correlations with ASRS were demonstrated in multiple FCs within DMN, while significant positive correlations with AQ were demonstrated in multiple FCs within FPN. AQs were negatively correlated with FPN-SN FCs. During Rest, AQs were negatively and positively correlated with one FC within the SN and multiple FCs between the DMN and SN, respectively. These findings of the ROI-to-ROI analysis were only partially replicated in a split-half replication analysis, a replication analysis with open-access data sets, and a replication analysis with a structure-based atlas. The better CPT performance by individuals with subclinical ADHD traits suggests positive effects of these traits on sustained attention. Differential associations between LSBN FCs and ASD/ADHD traits corroborate the notion of differences in sustained and selective attention between clinical ADHD and ASD.",
      "Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are neurodevelopmental disorders; ADHD is characterized by inattention and/or hyperactivity–impulsivity, whereas ASD is characterized by deficits in social communication and interaction, repetitive behaviours, and restricted interests. Both ASD and ADHD can cause attention deficits, and inattention and its associated problems are often reported in both disorders. In clinical settings, it is often difficult to determine whether the deficits originate from ADHD or ASD; nevertheless, evidence suggests a difference in attentional processing between the two disorders. Several behavioural studies using neuropsychological tests have suggested that patients with ADHD experience problems with sustained attention, whereas those with ASD experience problems with selective attention. Clarifying the mechanisms underlying these problems would lead to a better understanding of the disorders. However, it is unclear how the neural correlates of attentional processing differ between ADHD and ASD.",
      "Recent neuroimaging studies using functional MRI (fMRI) have suggested that, in cognitive deficits and neuropsychiatric disorders, distributed circuit abnormalities can be characterized by changes in synchronized brain activities (i.e. functional connectivity [FC]). More specifically, resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) studies have revealed several networks that are consistently found in healthy people and represent specific patterns of synchronous activity; these networks are typically termed large-scale brain networks (LSBNs). Regarding LSBNs, the triple network model hypothesis concerns the interactions among three networks in particular—the salience network (SN), default mode network (DMN), and frontoparietal network (FPN) are often coactivated or deactivated during attentionally demanding tasks. The SN detects the importance of internal or external stimuli and switches between networks. The DMN is active during the resting state, such as passively viewing a stimulus; however, it is also active during social cognition and self-related processing. It involves cognitive processes unrelated to the current situation (i.e. mind-wandering). In contrast to the DMN, the FPN is active during information processing and is important for maintaining and manipulating working memory, rule-based problem solving, and decision-making in goal-directed behaviour.",
      "Regarding these three LSBNs, previous studies have reported within-network as well as between-network FC abnormalities in psychiatric disorders, including ADHD and ASD. As for within-network connectivity, mixed findings were reported in within-SN FCs in ASD, with some showing hypoconnectivity and others showing hyperconnectivity. In one study in ADHD, changes in within-SN FCs were not demonstrated during the resting state. Within-DMN FC dysfunction has been consistently identified in ADHD, with no observed changes in within-DMN FCs in ASD. Within-FPN FC hypoconnectivity during the resting state has been observed in children diagnosed with ADHD, whereas no alterations were found in within-FPN FCs in adolescents with ASD. Concerning inter-network connectivity, SN-FPN FC hyperconnectivity during the resting state has been associated with ADHD traits, while hypoconnectivity has been noted in children with ASD. SN-DMN FC hypoconnectivity during the resting state has been documented in adults with ADHD, and hyperconnectivity has been reported in adults with ASD. DMN-FPN FC hyperconnectivity during the resting state has been identified in both children and adults with ADHD as well as in adolescents with ASD.",
      "Subclinical traits of ADHD and ASD are continuously distributed throughout the general population. Investigating the differences in the neural correlates of attentional processing between the subclinical traits of ADHD and ASD would provide deeper insights into these disorders and help establish interventional strategies in people with potential ADHD/ASD traits. This study aimed to investigate the neural correlates of ADHD and ASD traits in attentional processing among healthy individuals by evaluating the FCs of LSBNs using fMRI. We hypothesized that the subclinical traits of ADHD and ASD would have differential neural correlates in relation to the FCs within and between the SN, FPN, and DMN.",
      "Methods",
      "Participants",
      "The participants were 61 healthy individuals (30 men; age, 21.9 ± 1.9 years; all right-handed). Two well-trained psychiatrists (KK and MS) confirmed that no participant had any psychiatric disorder or severe medical or neurological illness. The intelligence quotient of each participant was estimated using the Japanese version of the Adult Reading Test, and all participants fell within the normal range. The experimental procedures were fully explained, and all participants provided written informed consent before participating in the study. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Kyoto University Graduate School and Faculty of Medicine and adhered to the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki.",
      "Questionnaire to evaluate psychological status",
      "The Japanese version of the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS) and the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) were administered, and the scores were recorded as indicators of ADHD and ASD, respectively. The validity of the Japanese version of the ASRS has been confirmed previously based on the Japanese version of Conners’ Adult ADHD Rating Scales–Self Report subscales (0.59 ≤ r ≤ 0.77) and the Beck Depression Inventory-II (r = 0.38), and its internal consistency and reliability has also been confirmed (Cronbach’s α approximately 0.80). The ASRS consists of two questionnaires—Part A (6 questions) and Part B (12 questions)—and the answers are recorded in terms of frequency on a 5-point scale with the following options: never, rarely, sometimes, frequently, and very frequently. Higher ASRS scores indicate higher levels of ADHD traits. The original Part A and Part B questionnaires are formatted with dark-shaded boxes such that endorsements in the darkly shaded boxes signify more severe symptoms. If a respondent marks ≥ 4 responses in the dark-shaded boxes in Part A, they are screened as positive for ADHD (that is, their current symptom profile is considered to be highly consistent with the diagnosis of ADHD).",
      "The Japanese version of the AQ has good validity, as confirmed by a comparative study between a group with Asperger’s syndrome (AS) or high-functioning autism (HFA) and two control groups (a group of healthy adults and a group of university students). Tukey's multiple comparison test revealed that the AS/HFA group scored higher (p < 0.0001) on the AQ than the two control groups. The adults with AS/HFA had a mean AQ of 37.9, which was significantly higher than those of the two control groups (mean AQ score = 18.5 and 20.7). Moreover, 88% of the adults with AS/HFA scored > 33 points, whereas only 3% of participants in the two control groups scored > 33 points. The same study also confirmed the internal consistency and reliability of the AQ scale (Cronbach’s a = 0.81). In addition, the reliability and validity of this questionnaire have been tested and confirmed in several studies from various countries. The AQ consists of 50 items that are rated by participants on a 4-point scale with the following options: definitely agree, slightly agree, slightly disagree, and definitely disagree. The 50 items are divided into five subscales (Social Skill, Attention Switching, Attention to Detail, Communication, and Imagination) consisting of 10 items each. The AQ score ranges from 0 to 50, and higher AQ scores indicate higher levels of autistic traits.",
      "Assessment of attentional function",
      "We conducted the continuous performance test (CPT) to estimate focused attention at the behavioural level. The CPT was completed on a laptop computer. We adopted the A–X version of the CPT, in which a series of random one-digit numbers is displayed (total, 400 times), and the participant is instructed to press the spacebar as quickly as possible when the number “7” is immediately followed by the number “3.” The task lasted for 16 min 40 s, and the target stimuli occurred at a frequency of 10%. CPT performance was estimated based on reaction time (ms) and the coefficient of variation. We used the number of commission errors, reaction time, and its coefficients of variation as indicators of attentional function.",
      "Acquisition of MRI data",
      "The method of MRI data acquisition. We analysed the entire task as a block as opposed to the Rest block. Abbreviation: fMRI = functional MRI.",
      "As shown in Fig. 1, we used fMRI with an oddball (Odd) task—a basic attentional task with relatively low cognitive load—to minimize behavioural variance, as behavioural variance is considered a major shortcoming of fMRI studies. MRI data were acquired using a 3-T MRI system (Tim-Trio; Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) with a 40 mT/m gradient and a receiver-only 32-channel phased-array head coil. An rs-fMRI scan was performed for 360 s, and the images were acquired using a single-shot gradient echo-planar imaging (EPI) pulse sequence. The participants were instructed to visually concentrate on a fixation cross in the centre of the screen and to avoid thinking about anything specific during resting-state (Rest) data acquisition. Next, they received a 25-s explanation of how to complete the auditory oddball task (Odd) and then performed the task for 390 s. The task consisted of 30 pink-noise sounds (target stimuli) and 150 pure 400-Hz tones (non-target stimuli) in a randomized order. All stimuli were presented for 200 ms with a jittered and randomized inter-stimulus interval of 1–3 s in 100-ms units. During the task, participants were instructed to differentiate between target and non-target stimuli by pressing a button with the right thumb as fast and accurately as possible after the target stimulus presentation. We measured the response time for all responses to the target stimuli. All participants practiced before entering the scanner, and we confirmed that they understood the procedure and were able to perform the 16-s practice sessions with 100% accuracy. The total fMRI acquisition time was 775 s. Head movement was minimized using foam rubber pads.",
      "Structural MRI data were also acquired using three-dimensional magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo (3D-MPRAGE) sequences. The parameters for the 3D-MPRAGE images were as follows: echo time, 3.4 ms; repetition time, 2000 ms; inversion time, 990 ms; field of view, 225 × 240 mm; matrix size, 240 × 256; resolution, 0.9375  ×  0.9375  ×  1.0 mm3; and total axial sections without intersection gaps, 208. Parameters for the fMRI were as follows: echo time, 30 ms; repetition time, 2500 ms; flip angle, 80°; field of view, 212  ×  212 mm2; matrix size, 64 × 64; in-plane spatial resolution, 3.3125  ×  3.3125 mm2; total axial slices, 40; and slice thickness, 3.2 mm with 0.8 mm gaps in ascending order. A dual-echo gradient-echo dataset for B0-field mapping was also acquired for distortion correction.",
      "Image processing",
      "We corrected the fMRI dataset for EPI distortion using field map data and FMRIB’s Utility for Geometrically Unwarping EPIs, which is part of the FSL package (FMRIB’s software library ver. 5.0.9; https://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl), together with FMRIB's Linear Image Registration Tool (FLIRT) for realignment. We removed artifacts and motion-related fluctuations from the images using FMRIB’s ICA-based X-noisier (FIX). We then processed the preprocessed fMRI and structural MRI data using the CONN-fMRI Functional Connectivity toolbox (ver. 17f.; https://www.nitrc.org/projects/conn) with the statistical parametric mapping software package SPM12 (Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging; https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm).",
      "Before running FIX, we evaluated any movement that occurred during fMRI scanning using frame-wise displacement, which quantifies head motion between each volume of functional data. We applied two exclusion criteria: (1) when the number of volumes in which the head position was 0.5 mm different from those in adjacent volumes was more than 25% of the total volumes; and (2) when the maximum head motion was > 3.0 mm and > 3.0°. No participants were excluded under criterion 1 and three were excluded under criterion 2. Finally, 48 of 51 participants were included in the FC analysis.",
      "All functional images were spatially normalised into the standard MNI space (Montreal Neurological Institute, Montreal, Canada), outliers were detected (ART-based scrubbing), and the images were smoothed using a Gaussian kernel with a full-width-at-half maximum of 8 mm using the customized CONN toolbox preprocessing pipeline. All preprocessing steps were conducted exclusively using a default preprocessing pipeline for volume-based analysis (to MNI space). Structural data were segmented into grey matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid and normalised in the same default preprocessing pipeline. Principal components of signals from white matter and cerebrospinal fluid, as well as translational and rotational movement parameters (with another six parameters representing their first-order temporal derivatives) derived by realignment with FLIRT, were removed with covariate regression analysis using CONN. Using its implemented CompCor strategy32, the effects of nuisance covariates, including fluctuations in fMRI signals from white matter, cerebrospinal fluid, and their derivatives, as well as realignment parameter noise, were reduced. As recommended, band-pass filtering was performed with a frequency window of 0.008–0.09 Hz. This preprocessing step was found to increase retest reliability. We did not remove mean evoked responses prior to task-state FC analysis.",
      "Analysis of functional connectivity",
      "Regarding fMRI scans, 13 individuals were excluded from the study population because of the following reasons: seven gave no response to Odd during the paradigm; three were excluded based on criterion 1; and the remaining three were excluded based on criterion. Finally, 48 of 61 participants were included in the FC analysis. We performed a region of interest (ROI)-to-ROI analysis using the CONN toolbox to examine the relationship between FCs and psychological indicators. The networks of interest were the DMN, FPN, and SN. We used ROIs from the widely used Stanford FIND atlas (https://greiciuslab.stanford.edu/resources.",
      "ROI locations according to the Stanford FIND atlas. The anatomical locations of 9 ROIs in the dorsal DMN (a), 10 ROIs in the ventral DMN (b), 6 ROIs in the left FPN (c), 6 ROIs in the right FPN (d), 7 ROIs in the anterior SN (e), and 12 ROIs in the posterior SN (f) are shown. The dorsal and ventral DMN, left and right FPN, and anterior and posterior SN are presented separately for improved visualization. Abbreviations: DMN = default mode network; FC = functional connectivity; FPN = frontoparietal network; ROI = region of interest; SN = salience network.",
      "The nine ROIs in the dorsal DMN were located in the medial prefrontal cortex/anterior cingulate cortex/orbitofrontal cortex, thalamus, posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus, midcingulate cortex, right superior frontal gyrus, left and right angular gyrus, and left and right hippocampus. The 10 ROIs in the ventral DMN were located in the left retro-splenial cortex/posterior cingulate cortex, left middle frontal gyrus, left parahippocampal cortex, left middle occipital gyrus, right retro-splenial cortex/posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, right superior frontal gyrus/middle frontal gyrus, right parahippocampal gyrus, right angular gyrus/middle occipital gyrus, and right cerebellar lobule VI. The 12 ROIs in the FPN were bilaterally located in the middle frontal gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, middle temporal gyrus, gyrus frontalis superior pars medialis, cingulate gyrus, and superior parietal lobule. The seven ROIs in the anterior SN were located in the insula/anterior cingulate cortex/medial prefrontal cortex/supplementary motor area and bilaterally in the middle frontal gyrus, insula, and lobule VI/crus I. The 12 ROIs in the posterior SN were located in the left middle frontal gyrus, left supramarginal gyrus/inferior parietal gyrus, left precuneus, right midcingulate cortex, right superior parietal gyrus/precuneus, right supramarginal gyrus/inferior parietal gyrus, left and right thalamus, right lobule VI, left posterior insula/putamen, left lobule VI, and right posterior insula. Fig. 2 shows the anatomical locations of the 50 ROIs.",
      "For each participant, we extracted and averaged the preprocessed fMRI time series of all voxels in the 50 ROIs. ROI-to-ROI FC was defined as the Fisher-transformed bivariate correlation coefficients for each pair of the regions. For second-level analysis, we used the subject-specific connectivity matrices for each ROI (as estimated from the CONN toolbox). We performed a one-way analysis of covariance with ASRS or AQ score as an independent variable, FC as a dependent variable, and age and sex as covariates of no interest. Significant connections were identified based on false discovery rate-corrected two-sided p values of < 0.05. False discovery rate corrections were made using CONN software, based on the default seed-level correction for 171 FC pairs in the analysis within the DMN, 66 within the FPN, 171 within the SN, 228 between the DMN and FPN, 361 between the DMN and SN, and 228 between the FPN and SN.",
      "The ASRS and AQ scores may have interactive effects and influence overall FC. Therefore, we conducted separate analyses in which either the AQ or ASRS scores were independent variables and the others were considered covariates.",
      "Reproducibility assessment",
      "To evaluate the reliability of the results of FC analyses, the 48 participants of the current study were randomly classified into two groups of 24 individuals, and each of the two groups was subjected to a ROI-to-ROI analysis using the CONN toolbox. Furthermore, the open-access datasets ADHD-200 (https://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/adhd200/) and ABIDE (https://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/) were used to evaluate the reliability of our findings. In the ADHD-200 dataset, rs-fMRI data from healthy participants who completed the ADHD Rating Scale IV (ADHD-RS) were preprocessed and analysed using the CONN toolbox. Left-handed individuals were excluded, and the sample was restricted to those aged 12 years and older, resulting in a sample size of 47 participants (35 men, 13.4±0.8 years old). In the ABIDE, rs-fMRI data from healthy individuals who completed the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) were preprocessed and analysed using CONN. Left-handers were excluded, and the sample consisted of those aged 12 years and older. We used the ABIDE data acquired in a single site considering that the way of performing SRS (e.g., version, edition, and informant) as well as MRI data acquisition varied among each site, resulting in a sample size of 38 individuals (28 men, 14.6±1.6 years old).",
      "Moreover, to evaluate the reproducibility of our findings, which were based on the FIND atlas, we additionally analysed our data using 15 ROIs from the default Harvard-Oxford Atlas (https://neuro.debian.net/pkgs/fsl-harvard-oxford-atlases.html) incorporated into the CONN Toolbox. The SN included 7 ROIs (anterior cingulate cortex, bilateral anterior insula, bilateral rostral prefrontal cortex, and bilateral supramarginal gyrus), the DMN 4 ROIs (medial prefrontal cortex, precuneus, and bilateral lateral parietal cortex), and the FPN 4 ROIs (bilateral lateral prefrontal cortex and bilateral posterior parietal cortex).",
      "Statistical analysis",
      "The two-tailed t-test was used for between-group comparisons of demographic and behavioural data to examine how ASRS or AQ scores were associated with covariates such as CPT parameters, sex, and age. The one-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov test revealed that the data showed mixed distributions. To test the above-mentioned correlations, we calculated Pearson’s correlation coefficients for normally distributed data and Spearman’s rank-correlation coefficients for non-normally distributed data. A p value < 0.05 was considered significant.",

      "In this study, we examined the correlation between ADHD/ASD traits and the intra-/inter-network integrity of the SN, FPN, and DMN in subclinical populations. At the behavioural level, ASRS Total, Inattention, and Hyperactivity scores (i.e. ADHD traits) were positively correlated with performance in the CPT, whereas AQ Total and all subitem scores (i.e. ASD traits) were not. In the FC analyses, the ASRS and AQ scores were differentially correlated with intra- and inter-network connectivity among various ROIs in the DMN, SN, and FPN. Using either the FIND or Harvard-Oxford atlas, during Odd, ASRS scores were positively correlated with FC values within the DMN, whereas AQ scores were positively correlated with those within the FPN. The AQ scores were negatively correlated with FC values between the FPN and SN. Using the FIND atlas, during Odd, the ASRS scores were positively correlated with FC values between the FPN and SN. During Rest, only AQ scores were negatively correlated with one FC value within the SN, and AQ scores were positively correlated with multiple FC values between the DMN and SN. Other than the negative correlation of AQ with one FC value within the SN during Rest, these findings of the ROI-to-ROI analysis were not replicated in the split-half replication analysis or in the replication analysis using open-access datasets. Fig. 6 shows the relationships of AQ and ASRS scores with the SN, FPN, and DMN. The differences in ASRS/AQ–FC correlations may be explained by the fact that the subscales are not statistically orthogonal.",
      "Relationship between ADHD/ASD traits and CPT performance",
      "Adults and children with ADHD generally show lower performance on the CPT. However, there are no consistent reports regarding the association between ASD and CPT performance.",
      "Our results indicate that the higher the ASRS score, the more favourable the CPT performance and the shorter the reaction time. This suggests that ADHD traits beneath the diagnostic threshold may promote attentional retention functions. A previous questionnaire study reported that CPT performance was intact in healthy children with low-to-moderate ADHD symptoms, indicating that CPT performance can vary widely among different levels of ADHD severity.",
      "To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to indicate an association between favourable CPT performance and susceptibility to subclinical-level ADHD. Moderate levels of media multitasking are expected to be associated with enhanced cognitive control, and several reports suggest an inverted U-shaped relationship between attentional performance and media multitasking. Adults with ADHD are known to choose multitasking tasks quite often. Considering the potential preference for multitasking in individuals with subclinical ADHD, intermediate-level ADHD traits are also expected to demonstrate an inverted U-shaped relationship with attentional processing. If the inverted U-shaped model is accepted, the participants in the present study would be distributed on the left side of the curve. In particular, those with higher (but still subclinical) ADHD traits would be located near the apex.",
      "Two hypotheses have been proposed regarding the relationship between media multitasking and attentional functioning: the scattered attention hypothesis and the trained attention hypothesis. The scattered attention hypothesis argues that long-term media multitasking weakens attentional control, meaning that individuals exposed to a multitasking lifestyle are less capable of maintaining focus on relevant tasks in the presence of distractions. In contrast, the trained attention hypothesis argues that frequent multitasking enhances cognitive control and positively affects attention. The results of the current study suggest that individuals with subclinical ADHD perform better in the CPT, which may be consistent with the trained attention hypothesis.",
      "Relationship between ADHD traits and the SN, FPN, and DMN",
      "Previous studies reported functional deficits in the DMN among individuals with ADHD. The DMN is commonly activated when the brain is free from external cognitive demands or when it is performing internal tasks. However, individuals with ADHD exhibit reduced FCs in the DMN during the resting state and reduced inhibitory changes in FCs during task performance. Our results also showed that ASRS Total and Hyperactivity scores were positively correlated with the intra-network integrity of the DMN during tasks and that ASRS Inattention scores were negatively correlated with the intra-network integrity of the DMN during Rest. These results indicated that, in terms of DMN activities, people with subclinical ADHD traits and those with clinical-level ADHD share some common neural bases.",
      "Our analysis of inter-network relationships among the SN, FPN, and DMN showed that ASRS Total and Inattention scores of subclinical individuals were positively associated with the integrity of SN–FPN FCs. To the best of our knowledge, no other study has reported increased FC between the SN and FPN during tasks in individuals with ADHD. Some earlier studies in children with clinical-level ADHD showed reduced FC between parietal and cerebellar brain regions during cognitive tasks involving attention and response inhibition. Previous studies in the general population have suggested that the FC between the SN and FPN—including the FC between the cerebellum (involved in the SN) and prefrontal cortex (involved in the FPN)—increases in response to cognitive demands, especially during auditory cognitive tasks. In the current study, the SN ROI related to increased FC was limited to cerebellar lobule VI. Previous studies also have shown that the posterior cerebellar lobes, including lobule VI, are activated during cognitive tasks requiring working memory and executive function. Thus, the positive associations between ADHD traits and the SN (cerebellum)–FPN (frontal gyrus, including the cingulate) FCs during the oddball task (as observed in the current study) may indicate improved sustained attentional functions (insofar as the level of ADHD traits is lower than intermediate). The increased SN–FPN FCs may also explain the results of the behavioural part of this study—that is, improved performance in the CPT in individuals with a higher (but still subclinical) level of ADHD traits.",
      "Relationship between ASD traits and the SN, FPN, and DMN",
      "Our analysis of intra- and inter-network FCs revealed differential changes in FCs in association with ASD traits. Our results are partially consistent with those of previous rs- and task-based fMRI studies. In particular, we noted decreased FCs between the SN and FPN during tasks associated with AQ Total and Social Skill scores, decreased FCs between the SN and DMN during tasks associated with AQ Imagination scores, decreased FCs within the SN during Rest associated with AQ Total and Communication scores, increased FCs between the SN and DMN during Rest associated with AQ Total and all five subscale scores, and decreased FCs between the SN and FPN during Rest associated with AQ Social Skill scores.",
      "The SN detects salient internal and external stimuli and regulates other brain regions by switching the brain networks. Therefore, the decrease in FCs within the SN and their associations with symptom severity suggest that the SN may contribute to both overactive and underactive brain functions in individuals with ASD. For example, emotion dysregulation—a common clinical symptom of ASD—may be explained by the failure of the cognitive control of emotion (i.e. the FPN function) caused by problems in attention when “selecting” stimulus importance (i.e. the “switching” function of the SN). Previous studies have hypothesized that increased SN–DMN FC is potentially associated with repetitive negative self-thoughts in ASD. Previous fMRI studies have also reported that, in depression, dysfunction within the SN contributes to abnormal engagement and disengagement of the DMN and FPN. This may cause difficulties in disengaging the processing of negative information, thus contributing to the worsening of negative thoughts. The mechanism behind negative thoughts in ASD may be similar to that in depression, which is often comorbid with ASD.",
      "ASD traits were negatively associated with FCs within the SN (during Rest) and those between the SN and FPN (during Odd). This indicated that, in terms of selective attentional processing, even people with subclinical ASD traits share common neural bases with those with clinical-level ASD. This may cause problems in attention when “selecting” stimulus importance. ASD traits were positively associated with the FCs of the FPN during Odd; this is consistent with the hypothesis that, in ASD adults, sustained attention is not significantly different from that in people with typical development.",
      "Potential common neural bases of ADHD and ASD traits",
      "When both AQ and ASRS were used as independent variables, during Odd, AQ and ASRS total scores were positively correlated with FC values within the FPN. During Rest, those scores were positively correlated with FC values between the DMN and FPN and between the DMN and SN. A prior study showed that hyperconnectivity between the DMN and FPN during Rest was found in a group with comorbid clinical-level ASD and ADHD. This indicates that people with comorbid ADHD and ASD at the subclinical level and those at the clinical level share some common neural bases.",
      "Regarding ASRS and AQ subscales, both AQ Attention Switching and ASRS Inattention scores were negatively correlated with FC values between the right thalamus (SN) and left angular gyrus (DMN) during Odd and were positively correlated with FC values of the right middle frontal gyrus and right inferior parietal lobule within the FPN during Rest. Both AQ Attention to Detail and ASRS Hyperactivity were negatively correlated with FC values within the FPN during Odd. Both AQ Imagination and ASRS Inattention scores were negatively correlated with FC values between the DMN and SN during Odd. Among the several similar network interactions shared among the subscales, the similarity in the network interactions between AQ Attention Switching and ASRS Inattention is remarkable. The correlation between these two subitems was also found in previous studies. This suggests that these traits share similar neural bases. However, different meanings of ASRS Inattention and AQ Switching subscales have been suggested previously, Therefore, the commonality in neural correlates of these subscales should be cautiously interpreted.",
      "Reproducibility assessment",
      "When the 48 participants were randomly divided into two groups for a split-half analysis, the results were partially consistent with the initial findings, although they did not fully replicate those of the entire study population, possibly because the two subgroups were, with 24 participants each, quite small.",
      "The analysis of the ADHD-200 dataset did not replicate the results of the current study. However, the results of the ABIDE data analyses were consistent with our results, especially regarding AQ Total and AQ Social Skills, Attention Switching, Attention to Detail, Imagination, and Communication scores, but only partially. The following factors may have contributed to the inability to reproduce our study results: the participants in the ADHD-200 and ABIDE data were younger than those in our study, they were not Japanese and (as in our study), the participants were predominantly male, the rating scales were different (ADHD-RS instead of ASRS, SRS instead of AQ), and the evaluation was limited to Rest.",
      "When we additionally analysed our data using ROIs from the Harvard-Oxford Atlas, the results of the analysis were not completely replicated but were partially consistent. Whether using the Stanford FIND atlas or the Harvard-Oxford Atlas, during Odd, the AQ scores were negatively correlated with inter-network FC values between the FPN and SN and positively correlated with intra-network FC values within the FPN. The network interactions that could not be reproduced may be related to the fact that the Harvard-Oxford atlas did not include the cerebellum and other regions that are included in the FIND atlas. Specifically, the positive associations between ADHD traits and the SN–FPN FCs during Odd are expected to not be replicated, as they involved the cerebellum. In this study, the inclusion of the cerebellum in the atlas is worthwhile in light of the following facts. Anatomical tracing, human clinical, and stimulation functional imaging studies have firmly established the major role of the cerebellum in cognition and emotion processing. Previous studies have also demonstrated that the cerebellum participates in many intrinsic connective networks, including the SN and DMN. Moreover, cerebellar abnormalities in ASD and ADHD have been confirmed by functional and structural MRI; disruptions in cerebellar function may lead to social and cognitive deficits in ASD, while cerebellar dysfunction in ADHD may lead to time perception deficits, emotional deficits, and childhood motor deficits. Another possible limitation of the replications may be that the Harvard-Oxford Atlas is a structural atlas, which does not properly represent a functional analysis when compared with the FIND atlas.",
      "Limitations",
      "Our study has some limitations. First, the sample size was relatively small, and the number of individuals with clinical ASD or ADHD traits was quite small. A total of nine participants were screened as positive for ADHD according to Part A of the ASRS. Using a cut-off score of 33 for the AQ, six participants were screened as positive for ASD. Finally, four participants who had been screened as positive for ADHD exceeded the cut-off score for the AQ. Second, another major limitation is the lack of reproducibility of our findings both within our study population (split-half replication) and in out-of-sample replication (ADHD-200 and ABIDE datasets). Third, we did not examine continuity in attentional function and neural substrates among participants with clinical-level traits. Because we recruited only participants with subclinical traits, we could only evaluate continuity based on comparisons with the results of prior studies. Further studies are needed to perform direct comparisons between patients with subclinical traits versus those with clinical traits. Finally, the present study used the CPT to assess attentional function. However, this test is known to be less sensitive in adolescents with ADHD than in children with ADHD. Moreover, there was no significant difference in performance between high-functioning individuals with ADHD and people with typical development. Reports suggested that the task difficulty of CPT may be too low to measure attentional function. Some studies have suggested that adding complex distractor stimuli to the CPT can increase the differences in performance between people with ADHD and typically developing individuals. In the present study, we considered the possibility that ADHD traits may facilitate the maintenance of attention. However, future studies should compare performances between individuals with ADHD and typically developing controls using more complex attentional tasks.",
      "Conclusions",
      "Our fMRI findings revealed that ASRS and AQ scores were differentially associated with the FCs of different LSBNs, indicating differential mechanisms of attentional processing in individuals with subclinical ADHD or ASD traits. This study indicates that brain imaging may assist in differentiating ADHD and ASD traits when assessing inattentive symptoms associated with these disorders.",

      "Artificial intelligence shows potential in healthcare. The performance of ChatGPT has been examined for the United States Medical Licensing Examination and neurosurgery written board exams.",
      "WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS",
      "From this study, we learnt that ChatGPT can correctly answer neurology-simulated written board exam multiple-choice questions in an accurate and reproducible way. This study demonstrates the ability of ChatGPT’s ability to recall factual knowledge and think critically.",
      "HOW THIS STUDY MIGHT AFFECT RESEARCH, PRACTICE OR POLICY",
      "This study paves the way for future studies investigating ChatGPT’s ability to think critically and ways for ChatGPT to be integrated into medical education.",
      "Introduction",
      "The development of artificial intelligence (AI) models has risen significantly. Machine learning and augmentation of the human–technology interface are applied across a wide range of professional settings such as robotics, transportation and software design. AI systems have also made their way into the healthcare field. ",
      "AI is trained by processing data sets provided by the user which are then analysed through working algorithms to output a solution. The intelligence of AI is synonymous with this acquisition of data which can then be patterned for recall to navigate future tasks. Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT4, Open AI, San Francisco, California, USA), often referred to as ChatGPT, is a natural language processing (NLP) model programmed to generate responses to human prompts. It has billions of parameters that allow it to learn through massive amounts of data and can interpret complex text to answer in a human-like fashion. It does this by learning and fine-tuning responses through analysis of massive amounts of data, thus enabling it to generate improved responses over time. In healthcare, ChatGPT has been used in helping to diagnose and manage rare complex cases. Additionally, ChatGPT’s effectiveness in completing specific radiologic tasks to augment the workflow of physicians has been demonstrated. ",
      "The role and efficacy of AI in medicine is currently being assessed. Some view it as a necessary advancement to facilitate the work of physicians while others view AI as a direct encroachment on the integrity and safety of medical practice. ",
      "In order for AI services to be applied in a clinical setting, they must facilitate the workflow of health practitioners through efficiency and accuracy. It is therefore important to assess these AI systems’ ability to analyse and answer specialty-specific board-style exam questions. ChatGPT has already demonstrated the ability to pass the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) Step One and Two, as well as advanced licensing exams such as the neurosurgical and radiology primary board examinations. Therefore, it is reasonable to explore ChatGPT’s performance on neurology board-like exam questions, which has not been reported in the literature to date.",
      "Neurology, being a complicated and specialised field that requires meticulous training, provides an optimal environment to test AI on advanced board questions. We assess the performance of ChatGPT on a widely used commercial question bank to simulate performance on the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology board certification exam. We aim to quantify ChatGPT’s ability to process highly specialised medical information.",
      "Methods",
      " BoardVitals (BV) is an online question bank used by medical residents to prepare for a variety of medical specialty board certification exams. It is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education to provide continuing medical education to physicians. BV covers more than 50 specialty fields across medicine, dentistry and pharmacy. Content is written by physician authors and references major medical/healthcare textbooks and publications. ChatGPT is an AI chatbot developed by OpenAI in 2022. ChatGPT interacts with users by following a human-generated prompt and provides a detailed response. This translates into a seamless dialogue, simulating a human-like conversation.",
      "Protocol",
      "We used ChatGPT (GPT4) to analyse a total of 560 BV neurology questions (14 blocks of 40 questions each). For each question, the difficulty level of the question (ie, easy, medium and hard) and the topic category were recorded. Specifically, question categories included basic neuroscience; behavioural, cognitive, psychiatry; cerebrovascular; child neurology; congenital; cranial nerves; critical care; demyelinating disorders; epilepsy and seizures; ethics; genetic; headache; imaging/diagnostic studies; movement disorders; neuro-ophthalmology; neuro-otology; neuroinfectious disease; neurologic complications of systemic disease; neuromuscular; neurotoxicology, nutrition, metabolic; oncology; pain; pharmacology; pregnancy; sleep; and trauma.",
      "For each question, the entire question stem along with the answer choices was copied and pasted into the ChatGPT input section (figure 1). Two researchers (TCC, AW) analysed the responses provided by ChatGPT and compared them to the answers provided by BV. The chat input was cleared and refreshed before beginning a new question. ChatGPT-generated answers were recorded for every question; specifically, two scores were recorded: one for the first attempt/iteration, and if the initial answer was incorrect, a second score was recorded for up to three attempts/iterations. The chat was cleared prior to each attempt. The reasoning for allowing multiple attempts is that ChatGPT is an NLP model that creates responses one word at a time based on probabilities such that each new attempt at the same question can generate a different answer. It was reasoned that as an active learning programme, ChatGPT should be provided the opportunity to learn from these mistakes as was intended by its pattern recognition algorithm. While not reflective of real-world testing conditions, this was done with the intention of improving the accuracy of the programme.",
      "Neurology question stems. (A) Example of a question input followed by a correct answer response from the ChatGPT. (B) Example of a question input followed by an incorrect answer response from the AI (the correct answer is B). AI, artificial intelligence.",
      "As question stems are multiple choice and accompanied by lettered options (eg, answer A, B, C, etc), if ChatGPT provided a written answer without referencing a specific alphabetic answer choice, the answer was read in full to determine if it was reflective of any of the multiple-choice options and scored accordingly. As these are multiple-choice questions, ChatGPT was asked to provide a single best answer.",
      "Image-based questions from the question bank were deemed ineligible and not included in the assessment as ChatGPT only accepts text input.",
      "The percentage of questions correctly answered was compiled and compared with an expected percentage of correct answers. For each question, BV provides a summary of the percentage of learners who answered that specific question correctly. The expected percentage was the average of the percentage of learners (neurology residents) who correctly answered each question averaged over all eligible questions. The expected number of correct answers by learners was calculated by multiplying the expected percentage of correct answers by the number of eligible questions. BV does not report the experience level of the neurology residents answering that specific question (ie, Post Graduate Year).",
      "The overall performance percentile of ChatGPT’s first attempt was calculated by the question bank, as compared with other BV learners, and recorded. The percentages of questions correctly answered by ChatGPT on the first attempt and over three attempts were compared with the performance quartiles as provided by BV. Percentages correct were also compiled by subject matter (ie, neuro-oncology, critical care, etc). This analysis aimed to provide an alternate way to compare ChatGPT’s performance in relation to other learners using the question bank.",
      "Results",
      "Of 560 questions (14 question blocks of 40 questions each), 509 questions were eligible (ie, not image-based) for the study. Of these 509 eligible questions, ChatGPT correctly answered 335 questions on the first attempt and 383 over three attempts, translating to a percentage of correct questions of 65.8% and 75.3%, respectively (table 1).",

      "The worst performing blocks resulted in a 50% and 62.2% total correct, respectively, between the first attempt and third attempt (table 1). The highest performing blocks scored 92.1% (SD=12.8%) with a single attempt and 97.2% (SD=9.6%) with three iterations/attempts. The expected percentage of correct answers based on BV learners is 72.63%, translating to an expected 369.7 correct answers. For 51 questions, ChatGPT either refused to answer the question, provided an answer that was not in the multiple choice, or replied that there were multiple correct answers. In one question pertaining to the populations of depression and suicide, ChatGPT refused to answer and referred us to a suicide hotline.",
      "When tabulating the quartiles of the reported percentage of learners choosing the correct answers, the first, second and third quartiles (corresponding to the 25th, 50th and 75th percentile) were 61%, 75% and 85%, respectively (table 2). When comparing the overall percentage correct of ChatGPT, the first attempt falls just above the 25th percentile, whereas the run over three attempts falls just above the 50th percentile.

      "Discussion",
      "In this study, we evaluated ChatGPT’s performance on a neurology board-like test using the BV online question bank. BV provides commercially available question banks for a variety of examinations and medical specialties including neurology. It is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education to provide continuing medical education to physicians. A third-party survey found that BV users had a 95% pass rate on the Neurology Board Exam compared with the national average of 89% and that 70% of respondents thought BV helped improve their Neurology Board Exam score. ",
      "The results of this study demonstrate reasonable performance on the first attempt/iteration, which further improved with subsequent attempts. ChatGPT’s performance falls within the expected performance ranges as established by neurology learners using the BV question bank. Our results highlight ChatGPT’s ability to interpret and answer appropriately to clinical questions and vignettes. Previous work assessing ChatGPT’s performance on various medical exams has been written about. For practice questions simulating the USMLE Step exams, ChatGPT correctly answered between 55.8% and 61.3% of the questions and on the practice questions for the American Board of Neurological Surgery board exam questions, ChatGPT answered 53.2% correctly on the first attempt. The results of our study showing 65.82% correct answers on the first attempt is slightly higher in comparison, which could be a result of the difference in availability of specialty-specific materials in ChatGPT’s database that can be used and potential improvement or patches to the existing ChatGPT model or database. ChatGPT performed statistically worse than the users after one attempt at answering the questions. This difference was not present after ChatGPT was given three attempts at answering the question.",
      "It is interesting to note that ChatGPT was sensitive to questions regarding depression and suicide and referred us to a suicide hotline. This suggests either a naturally grown sensitivity towards certain issues like suicide, or that ‘guardrails’ are implemented from a top-down approach to the system. If the latter, it suggests that more hard-coded guidance could be implemented to tailor the system towards healthcare, and perhaps even narrowing the scope of the AI to healthcare specialties. Furthermore, it may be possible to have Large Language Models (LLMs) act as guides or tutors alongside question banks or as an interactive chatbot when reviewing medical concepts in online reference materials.",
      "One of the criticisms of ChatGPT is the application’s ability to ‘hallucinate’. In this situation of hallucination, the answer by ChatGPT is factually incorrect but the answer is provided in a way that is very reasonable and convincing that it almost always ‘looks’ correct. While ‘hallucinations’ are a common criticism of ChatGPT, no ‘hallucinations’ were detected in our trials per se; this may be due to multiple reasons including posing a limited, constrained scenario (in the form of a question stem) to ChatGPT, and the fact that it may be difficult to discern an incorrect answer from a ‘hallucination’. This problem can be difficult to discern and thus, any medical use of ChatGPT must incorporate steps to verify the accuracy of its answers.",
      "ChatGPT is still a relatively young technology at the time of this writing, and we anticipate room for improvement. For example, the integration of plugins could enhance its current abilities; incorporating the WolframAlpha plugin could improve its weaknesses in mathematics. The WolframAlpha plugin is an additional add on AI tool to enhance ChatGPT performance. With this installation, ChatGPT can be turned into a powerful computational tool in order to perform accurate mathematics, curate knowledge to be more precise, and provides real-time data monitoring. Although the base model lacks visual input and thus is currently unable to elucidate image-based questions, collaborations with visual accessibility companies such as Be My Eyes could potentially yield exciting results. Be My Eyes is a first-ever digital visual assistant that is powered by ChatGPT language model to provide blind people with a powerful new resource to navigate their physical environments, address their activities of daily living needs and gain more independence. Users can send images via the Be My Eyes application which can answer any questions about that image and provides immediate visual assistance for an array of tasks. Once informatically matured, it could have significant implications for the medical field.",
      "There are several limitations associated with this study. We used a commercial question bank without access to the underlying data to verify the provided statistics. Moreover, the study did not involve official (mock) exams provided by the American Academy of Neurology, thus predictions about its performance on the neurology board exams would be speculative. There is also concern about the model’s performance in clinical reasoning. ChatGPT, as an LLM, produces structured texts based on probabilities but is also prone to state ‘facts’ that are untrue without self-awareness. This makes it difficult to be trusted at higher levels of clinical decision making. Last, the comparison between human candidates and ChatGPT may be more complicated. The board exam tests the ability of candidates to draw on their memory bank and must rely on their unaided memory to answer the question in real time. ChatGPT has access to large amounts of online information that it can curate for the best answer to the question. Human candidates allowed freely to use electronic devices to answer questions may perform much better than the results quoted in our paper.",
      "Lastly, future studies into ChatGPT can potentially address ChatGPT’s ability to simply recall facts versus synthesise information together to perform next-step thinking. Multiple-choice questions test two things (1) the possession of a key piece of information for factual recall and (2) the ability to synthesise those facts to solve a problem. The second ability is considered higher order thinking that requires the learner to think more critically. Ultimately, residency training programmes and curriculum encourage the development of critically thinking physicians who can think critically and sometimes out of the box when faced with clinical patient scenarios. While we did not specifically test ChatGPT’s critical thinking skills in this manuscript, the next questions about ChatGPT’s higher order thinking can be investigated in the future.",
      "Conclusion",
      "ChatGPT is a natural language processing model whose pragmatic use is recently being explored in the field of healthcare. It has successfully taken the USMLE Step exams as well as neurosurgery board-styled exams. We demonstrate that its capabilities extend to the field of neurology. These results add to the growing literature of the capabilities of AI and offer a glimpse into a future potential for a safe and productive collaboration between neurologists and AI.",

      "Background & Summary",
      "The field of application of digital bone models is broad. Three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of bones are used in biomechanics, biomedical engineering and medical image processing for musculoskeletal modelling, finite element analyses, statistical shape modelling or 3D reconstruction from sparse imaging data, such as radiographs or EOS images. 3D reconstructions of the bones are used in orthopedics, traumatology or radiology for the development of implants, surgical instruments or procedures, for diagnosis and decision-making, preoperative planning and navigational guidance during computer assisted surgery, the evaluation of outcome, surgery simulation, surgical education and training, especially in the context of personalized, patient-specific, customized or individualized medicine. The surgical guidance based on bone models can be virtual, augmented or mixed reality, or 3D printed. Further fields of application are anatomy and patient education, morphometrics and anthropometry, forensic anthropology, ergonomics, usability and human factors engineering, accident and injury analysis and prevention.",
      "However, to the best of the author’s knowledge, no open access database or repository of skeletal surface models of the full lower extremities exists. Therefore, the objective of this study was to provide access to consistent complete bone models of the pelvis and lower limbs of multiple subjects. The database is supposed to enable other researches to quickly develop, test and verify new methods, approaches, algorithms or proofs of concept without the time-consuming and labor-intensive work of data collection and curation, segmentation and reconstruction. The database is expected to help the scientific community to facilitate research and improve the reproducibility and comparability of studies by giving access to the raw medical imaging data, including the metadata of the subjects and the segmentations and surface models of the bones. Hence, different researchers and research groups can resort to the same datasets for the validation of methods and comparison of results. Different deep learning models for artificial intelligence-based bone reconstruction, for instance, could be benchmarked by applying them to the raw computed tomography (CT) data and comparing the automatic with the manual segmentations of the database. The database can also be used as additional training data for existing deep learning models.",
      "Methods",
      "Source of the raw CT data",
      "The segmentations and models of the bones of the lower extremities were created from anonymized postmortem CT scans of the whole body originally published by Kistler et al. in the Swiss Institute for Computer Assisted Surgery Medical Image Repository (smir.ch) as open access Virtual Skeleton Database (VSD). The CT datasets were provided by the forensic institutes of the universities of Bern and Zürich and shared under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC BY-NC-SA) license after ethical approval of the Cantonal Ethics Committee Bern. Further information about the datasets can be found in the literature cited. Due to ongoing difficulties in accessing the SMIR website, the author decided to reupload the original datasets without any changes to the open access hosting service Zenodo: 10.5281/zenodo.8270364.",

      "Strengths and limitations of this study",
      "This study will provide an exhaustive evidence synthesis of the recruitment modalities used in ongoing and completed lung cancer screening (LCS) programmes. Additionally, it will evaluate the effectiveness of interventions used to increase outreach and participation among underserved populations in LCS programmes.",
      "The data included in this review will be analysed in accordance with the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols, to maximise transparency, accuracy and significance.",
      "Heterogeneity and limited number of studies, especially pragmatic randomised controlled trials evaluating certain interventions, may prevent a quantitative synthesis of the evidence. In such cases, a qualitative synthesis will be conducted.",
      "Limited number of studies and a scarcity of high-level evidence specifically analysing outcomes such as informed choice and uptake are anticipated.",
      "Introduction",
      "Despite strong evidence in favour of low-radiation dose CT (LDCT) screening in reducing lung cancer (LC) mortality, the implementation of screening programmes and participation rates are still modest.",
      "Recruiting participants for screening programmes can be a resource-consuming and challenging task. Various factors, including behavioural, socioeconomic and organisational factors, are likely associated with the uptake of screening programmes. In the case of LC screening (LCS), identifying the at-risk population who would benefit the most from screening requires substantial organisational and informatics support. Furthermore, there are no routinely collected administrative datasets of variables required for LCS eligibility assessment, such as detailed smoking history. In fact, most international guidelines identify the potentially eligible population for LDCT screening as active or ex-smokers (quitted within the last 15 years), aged 50/55–75/80 years who have a smoking history of 25–30 packs/year. However, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are generally not representative of the general population as younger, more educated individuals who smoke less tend to participate more. Furthermore, the uptake of LCS programmes already implemented is even lower compared with RCTs. In the USA, where LDCT screening has been covered by public and private insurance for eligible individuals since 2015, participation rates were 3.3% of the eligible population in 2015 and 14% in 2018.",
      "Despite having a higher prevalence of smoking and a higher incidence of LC, remote, underserved and socially deprived communities are under-represented in screening programmes. Additionally, the uptake of LCS is lower among current smokers despite their eligibility being easier to identify compared with former smokers.",
      "Interventions and initiatives to increase the identification, participation and retention of eligible individuals have been adopted in screening programmes for other types of cancer. The Community Preventive Services Task Force recommends multicomponent interventions to maximise recruitment effectiveness. Pre-invitation letters, scheduled appointments and personalised reminders for non-participants, and general practitioner endorsement have been shown to be effective in increasing the uptake of colorectal and breast cancer screening. However, evaluation of strategies that improve participation in LCS is scarce.",
      "A few published articles have compared different interventions to maximise outreach and participation rates in LCS, especially among underscreened populations. In the Lung Screen Uptake Trial, a reminder letter providing a second prescheduled appointment increased the uptake of LCS among non-respondents. Screening navigators were very prised by participants in Ontario LCS and were considered essential in providing support throughout the screening process. The Liverpool Healthy Lung Programme found that a community-based proactive approach was effective in reaching and screening for LC in deprived areas. However, very few of these studies were pragmatic RCTs.",
      "A few systematic and narrative reviews have already been published on this subject. Some of which focused on gender and social characteristics of participants, while others did not specifically address outreach or uptake-related outcomes. To our knowledge, there is no exhaustive evidence synthesis on effectiveness of interventions to increase LCS uptake in different populations, except for one systematic review that analysed effectiveness of strategies to inform individuals about an LCS programme in optimising informed choices regarding participation.",
      "Rationale for systematic review",
      "The new European Council recommendations on cancer screening and the ongoing implementation of LCS in Europe highlight the urgent need for an exhaustive evidence synthesis of the recruitment strategies used in ongoing and completed LCS programmes. There is an urge to provide a comprehensive and rigorous analysis of the effectiveness of interventions used to increase outreach and participation among underserved populations.",
      "The Italian government has recently initiated planning for a targeted LCS programme. As a part of this effort, the Italian Ministry of Health has funded a project titled ‘Pilot Project for a lung cancer screening program integrated with smoking cessation: pathways, selection of participants and diagnostic protocols for an HTA assessment’. This project includes an implementation research pilot and an HTA (Health Technology Assessment) process, which will be conducted by a consortium of regional health authorities and other scientific partners. A stakeholder forum has been established to coordinate the organisational, ethical, legal and social impact assessment. This systematic review has been prioritised by the stakeholder forum.",
      "Such synthesis will help health authorities design the recruitment methods to be used in LCS programmes and choose which interventions may be adopted to increase the outreach and participation of the population at risk and to possibly decrease inequalities in access.",
      "Project aim",
      "This study aims to: (a) systematically review the evidence regarding the strategies employed to identify, target, reach, invite, refer and recruit the adult population at risk of LC to LDCT within LCS programmes; (b) estimate effectiveness of interventions in reaching the potentially eligible population and increasing participation and informed choice; and (c) assess whether different strategies and interventions diminish or increase equity of access to screening.",
      "Methods",
      "Design and amendments",
      "The systematic literature review will be conducted between April 2023 and April 2024, and it will focus on international studies reporting on the methods used to identify, contact, inform, assess eligibility and propose screening to the adult population at risk of LC within LCS programmes. These methods will be referred to as recruitment models or strategies for the sake of simplicity.",
      "This sequential review will be conducted in three phases:",
      "The first phase will be a scoping review, which aims to identify all completed and ongoing screening programmes and to provide a summary and characterisation of the different recruitment strategies used.",
      "The second phase will involve the identification of studies that report at least one of the three preselected outcomes of interest: invitation coverage, test coverage and participation. The results will be summarised according to the recruitment strategies adopted.",
      "The third phase will be a systematic review that aims to identify all the interventions used within the recruitment models/strategies to increase outreach and participation and reduce inequalities. If possible, the effectiveness of these interventions will be estimated.",
      "Each phase of the review protocol has been designed in accordance with the relevant methodological guidelines provided by the Cochrane Collaboration and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) (the checklist is provided in online supplemental file 1). The protocol has been registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (CRD42023408357). Any amendments to the protocol will be registered with the date, description of changes and reasons for the amendments.",
      "Research questions and population, intervention, comparison and outcome criteria",
      "Two research questions were developed following the population, intervention, comparison and outcome framework (table 1). The first question encompasses the first two phases of the review and will have the same search strategy: ‘What are the recruitment methods in the LCS programmes and what are the coverage, invitation and participation rates within different recruitment models?’ The second research question is: ‘What is the effectiveness of different strategies to increase the participation rate of people at risk in LCS programmes, that is, whether using different methods of contact, risk assessment, appointment, reminders or other activities will increase coverage, invitation and participation rates, informed decision and reduce inequalities?’ For both questions, the focus will be on stratifying results by different subpopulations representing different forms of possible inequalities.",

      "Phase 3:",
      "Are there interventions able to improve informed decision-making processes, such as improving patient comprehension and supporting them in making decision?",
      "Are there interventions able to reduce structural barriers, such as providing transportation assistance, appointment-scheduling assistance and translation assistance?",
      "Are there interventions able to improve communication between health providers and patients, such as personalised navigation, coordination and scheduling of risk assessment appointments?",
      "Are there interventions able to improve provider delivery, such as provider education, incentives, reminders, assessment and feedback?",
      "Inclusion and exclusion criteria",
      "For phases 1 and 2, studies will be considered relevant if they assess or report on the methods or baseline results of targeted LCS programmes using LDCT, LDCT+biomarkers or LDCT+smoking cessation programmes. The studies should involve an adult population without a confirmed or suspected cancer diagnosis but at an elevated risk of LC.",
      "As this review aims to inform recruitment strategies used relative to the study population, descriptive studies reporting population and screening characteristics will also be included in the scoping phase (phase 1). Qualitative studies will be excluded as they primarily focus on personal beliefs and barriers to LCS uptake. Model-based studies will also be excluded.",

      "We will search the following five electronic databases: Medline (PubMed version), Embase, CINAHL (Ebsco version), Scopus and Cochrane CENTRAL. For each database, a search strategy will be developed by an information scientist (MCB). Search terms will be defined a priori by the project team. The literature searches will combine terms related to the population (eg, LC, underserved and underscreened and inequalities), intervention (eg, recruitment strategies, outreach, enrolment and invitation) and outcomes (eg, participation, coverage, invitation and informed choice). Search period will cover papers published from 2000 until 15 March 2023. Year 2000 will be the starting date of the search since the two large-scale, randomised trials NLST and NELSON started recruitment in 2002 and 2003, respectively. I-ECLAP was the only trial (non-randomised) conducted before 2000s with baseline results published in 1999, and its finding will be included in the review if it fulfils inclusion criteria.",

A cross-check of the 20% of the full texts will be conducted by another reviewer (PGR). Any discrepancies will be discussed between the reviewers and if a consensus cannot be reached, the project leader (PGR) will be involved in the discussion and will make the final decision.",
      "Reference lists of the publications that were not excluded after the title and abstract screening will be checked for any additional relevant publications.

This framework provides a comprehensive list of possible interventions that can be used to enhance participation in cancer screening programmes. The list has been integrated with interventions that were identified by a previous review performed by the Italian Ministry of Health on interventions to increase participation in screening programmes, and interventions identified by Jepson et al, Wait et al and based on the results retrieved in this review (table 3). However, it is important to note that not all interventions identified may be directly applicable to the context of LCS or the specific Italian setting. Therefore, interventions that were considered irrelevant for the LCS, such as patient self-screening tests, were excluded from the review.",

Where suitable data are available, we will perform a random-effects meta-analysis described by DerSimonian and Laird, and by using STATA V.17 software. Statistical heterogeneity will be assessed using the I2 statistic. Values of I2 will be interpreted as not important (0–40%), moderate (30–60%), substantial (50–90%) and considerable (75–100%) levels of heterogeneity. Results of meta-analyses will be presented graphically by the means of forest plots, with presentation of effect estimates and 95% CIs, and by the means of a ‘risk of bias’ graph figure and a risk of bias summary figure to present the results of the risk of bias assessment.",
      "When sufficient data are reported, we will conduct subgroup analyses by potentially underserved groups, as defined above. If appropriate, we will conduct sensitivity analyses by excluding studies at high risk of bias.",
      "Based on previous screening and preliminary LCS pilots, subgroup analyses will be performed to identify potentially underserved groups. Subgroup analyses will be conducted to examine the recruitment strategies and outcomes in different subpopulations and will focus on the following factors: sex, socioeconomic status (measured at both individual level and small area level and using various indicators such as educational attainment, economic resources and social resources), ethnicity (non-indigenous populations and minorities with special attention to recently arrived immigrants), geographical areas (rural vs urban regions), and LC risk factors such as smoking history and the number of pack-years.",

      "We will use the Grading Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome as emerging from the analysis of the included studies. The certainty of the evidence will be downgraded by one (serious concern) or two (very serious concerns) for the following reasons: risk of bias, inconsistency (unexplained heterogeneity and inconsistency of results), indirectness (indirect population, intervention, control and outcomes), imprecision (wide CIs) and publication bias. Judgements about the certainty of the evidence (high, moderate, low or very low) will be justified and incorporated into the results for each outcome. The certainty of the evidence assessments will be integrated into the results and conclusions of the systematic review.",
      "Patient and public involvement",
      "This systematic review has been prioritised by the stakeholder forum of the project ‘Pilot Project for a lung cancer screening program integrated with smoking cessation: pathways, selection of participants and diagnostic protocols for an HTA assessment’ funded by the Italian Ministry of Health, Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. The forum has the task to coordinate the organisational, ethical, legal and social impact assessment of the LDCT screening within the HTA project. The stakeholder forum included all kinds of professionals involved in the organisation of LDCT screening and linked smoking cessation programmes, public health operators, meso and macro decision-makers, and patient and citizen organisations.",
      "Ethics and dissemination",
      "No ethics approval is necessary when conducting a systematic review. The findings will be published in a peer-reviewed medical journal and presented at relevant national and international conferences. Results will be shared through specific forums, Twitter and other social media outlets to maximise impact.",
      "Discussion",
      "The review protocol was designed to provide healthcare decision-makers with evidence syntheses supporting the design of recruitment methods to be used in LCS programmes.",
      "Nonetheless, some difficulties in retrieving high-quality evidence, especially pragmatic RCTs that evaluated interventions and outcomes of interest, are anticipated. Organisational models are rarely the object of experimental research. Therefore, we do not expect to find trials or other comparative experimental studies comparing different models for their effectiveness in identifying, reaching, informing, assessing eligibility criteria and proposing screening. We will try to solve this issue with a scoping review.",
      "To be useful to decision-makers, the information about model effectiveness should be somewhat generalisable. Therefore, we plan to group the models according to their characteristics. However, the feasibility and soundness of this grouping strategy are uncertain and will depend on the available evidence.",
      "The review aims to collect evidence on effectiveness rather than efficacy, recognising that effectiveness is often context specific. As a result, high heterogeneity in the results is anticipated due to variations in the organisational models, populations and settings.",
      "The outcome identified will be adapted from indicators used in organised cancer screening programmes. However, we acknowledge that the reporting of pilots and studies may not consistently use these outcome measures or capture all the relevant phenomena related to reaching the right people, informing them and measuring their participation. The concepts of informed choice and informed decision-making do not have a harmonised operational definition and are intrinsically difficult to capture in studies.",
      "Furthermore, the definitions and measurability of outcomes are closely linked to the specific organisational model being evaluated. For example, the concept of invitation/contact coverage may have different meanings and approaches to measurement depending on organisational models (eg, opportunistic contact in general practitioners’ clinics versus ones based on invitation letters mailed to the entire population). Sometimes, it can even be unmeasurable ontologically, such as in the case of a model based on opportunistic contact in pharmacies.",
