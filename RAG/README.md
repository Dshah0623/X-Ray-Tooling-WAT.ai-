## To do:

1. Ingest more datasets for RAG
2. Preprocessing:
   - Chunk documents into smaller documents?
   - improve document format to include more metadata
   - integrate document embeddings beforehand to reduce context going into RAG on our end
3. Build a webscraping tool to automage ingestion
4. Integrate with GPT api to compare performance
5. Prompt engineering to iterate on quality of cohere calls
