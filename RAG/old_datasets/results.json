Scientists agree that the root cause of this neurological disease is a combination of genetics, long-term environmental conditions, and lifestyle. Though some medications are available, AD is not curable, and the damage it causes is permanent. The most common cause of death in Alzheimer\u2019s patients is aspiration pneumonia. Though machine learning (ML) is a very potent technique in AD diagnosis, patients nowadays are more likely to visit clinics and have their AD diagnosed. Even doctors",

Day by day the number of Alzheimer\u2019s patients is rising. Considering the increasing rate and the dangers, Alzheimer\u2019s disease should be diagnosed carefully. Machine learning is a potential technique for Alzheimer\u2019s diagnosis but general users do not trust machine learning models due to the black-box nature. Even, some of those models do not provide the best performance because of",

Introduction Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD) is a chronic, progressive neurodegenerative disease that gradually deteriorates memory and cognitive abilities, and it is the most common cause of dementia in older people. In the world, there were more than 50 million AD sufferers in 2018. Worldwide, there will be 131 million persons with AD in 2050, and the socioeconomic cost will be 9.12 trillion dollars. Forgetting recently acquired information, important dates or events, difficulty in performing simple daily works, and repeatedly asking the same questions are all",

Results and conclusions The performance evaluation demonstrates that the RF classifier has a 10-fold cross-validation accuracy of 98.81% for predicting Alzheimer\u2019s disease, cognitively normal, non-Alzheimer\u2019s dementia, uncertain dementia, and others. In addition, the study utilized Explainable Artificial Intelligence based on the SHAP model and analyzed the causes of prediction. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to present this multimodal (Clinical, Psychological, and MRI segmentation data) five-class classification of Alzheimer\u2019s disease using Open Access Series of Imaging",
    "chunk1": "using only neuroimaging data. Objective To solve these issues, this paper proposes a novel explainable Alzheimer\u2019s disease prediction model using a multimodal dataset. This approach performs a data-level fusion using clinical data, MRI segmentation data, and psychological data. However, currently, there is very little understanding of multimodal five-class classification of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Method For predicting five class classifications, 9 most popular Machine Learning models are used. These models are Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Gradient Boosting (GB), Adaptive Boosting (AdaB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naive Bayes (NB).
